# User simulator for chatbot testing

##Description
The evolution of technology increased the complexity of chatbots and also it's testing methods. With the introduction of LLMs, chatbots are capable of humanizing
conversations and imitating the pragmatics of natural language. Several approaches have been created in order to evaluate the
performance of chatbots. The code in this project allows creating test cases based in conversations that a user simulator will have
with the chatbot to test.

## Usage

In order to run the simulator, a specific chatbot should be deployed previously (i.e Taskyto, Rasa...). 
The script "autorun.py" contains the functions tu load the user simulator profile, start a conversation with the chatbot 
and save this conversation and it's configuration par√°meters. The user simulator profile is stored in yaml files,
which should be located in some folder (`user_sim/yaml/user_sim_bikesqa.yaml`).

## Environment Configuration

API keys can be set as environment variables.
The most important API key is `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

## User Profile YAML Configuration

This file contains all the properties the user will follow in order to carry out the conversation. Sice the user simulator is
based in OpenAI GPT4-o LLM technologie, some of the fields should be written as prompts in natural language. For this fileds, a 
prompt engineering task should be carried out by the programmer to narrow down the role of the user simulator and guide its
behaviour. A description of the fields and an exaple of the YAML structure is described below.

```
temperature: 0.8                      #parameter that controls the randomness and diversity of the responses generated by the LLM.

isstarter: True                       #defines wether the user simulator or the chatbot will start the conversation.

role:                                 
  "you have to act as a user ordering a
  pizza to a pizza shop"

```
