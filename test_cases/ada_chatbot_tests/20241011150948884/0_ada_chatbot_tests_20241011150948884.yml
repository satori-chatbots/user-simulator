- User: Hi there! So, I'm trying to figure out how much it would cost me to study
    computer engineering at the Autonomous University of Madrid, but like, I have
    no clue where to start looking for this information, you know? I mean, I've heard
    it's a great university and all that, but I just need to get an idea about the
    tuition fees or anything related to the costs, so I can start planning ahead and
    maybe even save up some cash, cause, you know, university isn't exactly cheap
    these days. If anyone can help out with some details or point me in the right
    direction, that would be super awesome!
