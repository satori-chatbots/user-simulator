- User: Hi there! So, like, I'm not sure if I'm doing this right, but I need some
    help with my UAM email account because it seems like I'm having trouble accessing
    it, and I don't know if it's a password issue or something else, and I've tried
    resetting it but I'm not even sure if I'm using the right email address since
    there are so many different things to remember already and it's getting kind of
    confusing with all the different platforms and logins and stuff, so I was wondering
    if there's like a guide or something that can show me how to properly use the
    email address from UAM because I really need to access it for my classes and assignments
    and all that stuff, you know?
