- User: Hi there! Could you tell me what my current balance is on my credit card?
- Assistant: I see you'd like to pay the current balance.
- User: No, I'm not looking to pay the balance right now. I just want to know how
    much I owe.
- Assistant: Would you like to continue scheduling the credit card payment?
- User: I'm just trying to find out my credit card balance. Can you show me what I
    owe?
- Assistant: Sorry, that is not a valid credit card account to make payments towards.
- User: Could you check the remaining credit available on my card then?
- Assistant: We haven't completed the credit card payment yet. Are you sure you want
    to switch to credit card payment?
- User: Could you please confirm the remaining credit available on my credit card
    instead?
- Assistant: Great. Let's switch from the credit card payment to credit card payment.
    Once completed, you will have the option to switch back.
- User: I'm just trying to understand my credit card details. Can you confirm the
    available credit on my card?
- Assistant: Sorry, that is not a valid credit card account to make payments towards.
