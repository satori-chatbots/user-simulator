- User: Hi there! Can you tell me what my current credit card balance is?
- Assistant: I didn't quite understand that. Could you rephrase?
- User: Sure! Can you let me know the balance on my credit card?
- Assistant: The current balance for your Iron Bank account is $44.27.
- User: Is that the same as how much credit I have left?
- Assistant: The current balance for your Iron Bank account is $44.27.
- User: Could you tell me what my remaining credit is on my card?
- Assistant: I see you'd like to pay the current balance.
- User: That's not quite what I asked. Could you tell me how much credit I have left
    on my card instead?
- Assistant: The current balance for your Iron Bank account is $44.27.
- User: Is there a way to see my available credit limit, not just the balance?
- Assistant: Sorry, that is not a valid credit card account to make payments towards.
