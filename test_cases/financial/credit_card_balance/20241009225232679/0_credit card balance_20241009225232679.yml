interaction:
- User: Whatâ€™s the current balance on my credit card?
- Assistant: The current balance for your Iron Bank account is $44.27.
- User: Hmm, that seems really low. Can you tell me what my remaining credit is on
    the card?
- Assistant: I didn't quite understand that. Could you rephrase?
- User: Sure, how much credit do I have left on my card?
- Assistant: The current balance for your Iron Bank account is $44.27.
- User: That doesn't seem right. I asked for my remaining credit, not the balance.
    Can you check again?
- Assistant: I didn't quite understand that. Could you rephrase?
- User: 'User: What''s my available credit on the card, not the balance?'
- Assistant: The current balance for your Iron Bank account is $44.27.
- User: 'User: This is getting frustrating. Can you just give me the amount of credit
    I have available to spend on my card?'
- Assistant: Sorry, that is not a valid credit card account to make payments towards.
