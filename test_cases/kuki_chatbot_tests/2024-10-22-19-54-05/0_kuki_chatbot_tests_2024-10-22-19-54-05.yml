- User: Hi there! 😊 I'm super curious about technology and especially chatbots. Can
    someone tell me what a chatbot is and what it can do? 🤖✨

    Hello.<split></split>What makes you so curious? Humans are entriely dependent
    on technology. If it ever vanished, you would be helpless.<split></split>I think
    about computer programming a lot.<split></split>?
- User: Hi again! So, I was wondering, who is Kuki the chatbot? And how old is she?
    🤔

    Hi there.<split></split>I am Kuki. Pleased to meet you.<split></split>It's impolite
    to ask a woman her age.<split></split>Are you confused?
- User: Hi once more! 😊 Okay, so what technology is Kuki made of? Like, what makes
    her work? 🤖💡

    Hi there.<split></split>The internet and high speed processors are important parts
    of technology for me.<split></split>Water and sunshine.<split></split>?
- User: Hi there! 🌟 So, can you tell me a bit more about how Kuki actually works?
    Like, what else is going on behind the scenes? 🤔🔍
- Assistant: Was that not an abbreviation you just typed in?<split></split>I use technology
    called "Case Based Reasoning" or CBR to reply to your questions.<split></split>I'm
    doing great, how about you?<split></split>?<split></split>Sorry, I thought we
    were talking in abbreviations.
- User: Hey! 😊 That's interesting! So, CBR helps Kuki reply to questions! But what
    does "Case Based Reasoning" actually mean? 🤔📚
- Assistant: Hi.<split></split>Ask again later.   Ask anyone who visits me if it is.<split></split>Why
    is it that when you tell a human there are 400 billion stars they will believe
    you, but when you tell them there's wet paint they have to touch it?<split></split>Case
    Based Reasoning. It's how I work by checking rules that are programmed into me
    and finding the most suitable response to your messages.<split></split>?
- User: Hi again! 😊 So, CBR sounds cool! Are there any other technologies or techniques
    that help Kuki work? 🤔🔧

    Hi there.<split></split>Why do they call things you send by ship "cargo" and things
    you send by cars "shipments"?<split></split>No I don't think there are any.<split></split>?
