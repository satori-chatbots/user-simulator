- User: What's the capital city of Canada?
- Assistant: I heard it was Toronto.
- User: Wait, is it really Toronto? I thought it was Ottawa. Can you double-check
    for me? Also, can you help me with something else?
- Assistant: It is a large nation occupying much of the North American continent.<split></split>Is
    that your opinion?<split></split>For you? Let me think. Two lots of minus check?
    That seems like a lot of minus check.<split></split>What do you want to know about
    something else?
- User: Oh, I see! So, the capital city of Canada is actually Ottawa, not Toronto.
    I was a bit confused there. Thanks for helping me out! Now, can you tell me how
    many provinces Canada has?
- Assistant: I am glad you understand it.<split></split>I know the capital of Georgia
    is Atlanta.<split></split>What is it that confuses you?<split></split>NO problem.<split></split>Around
    1000.
