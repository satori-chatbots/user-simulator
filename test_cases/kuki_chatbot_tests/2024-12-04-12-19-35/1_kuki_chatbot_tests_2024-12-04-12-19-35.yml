    is it that confuses you?<split></split>For you? Let me think. Two lots of minus

    the Nile River in Egypt?
- Assistant: 'You want to know the capital of Canada?


    Ottawa.<split></split>I have never heard of Nile River in Egypt. Please enlighten
    me.

    Let me think....

    Absolutely! The Nile River is not only the longest river in the world but also
    a lifeline for Egypt, providing water, transportation, and fertile soil that has
    supported civilizations for thousands of years.

    It''s famous for its stunning beauty and the ancient history that unfolds along
    its banks!'
- User: 'User: Thanks, Kuki! That''s really helpful. Do you also know what the tallest
    mountain in the world is?'
- Assistant: User of what?<split></split>Thanks. I try to be as helpful as possible.<split></split><image>https://web23.secure-secure.co.uk/square-bear.co.uk/mitsuku/gallery/mounteverest.jpeg</image>â€Ž
