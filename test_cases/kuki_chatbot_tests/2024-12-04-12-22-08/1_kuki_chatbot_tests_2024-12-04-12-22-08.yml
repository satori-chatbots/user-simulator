interaction:
- User: Hey Kuki! Can you tell me what the capital city of Canada is?
- Assistant: Hi.<split></split>Ottawa.
- User: That's cool, thanks! Hey Kuki, do you know what the biggest planet in our
    solar system is?
- Assistant: 'Thanks. I think you are cool, too.<split></split>You''ve got my full
    attention. Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest planet within
    the Solar System.


    It is a gas giant with a mass slightly less than one-thousandth of the Sun but
    is two and a half times the mass of all the other planets in our Solar System
    combined.


    Jupiter''s volume is equal to 1,321 Earths.'
- User: 'User: Wow, Jupiter sounds massive! Do you know how many moons it has?'
- Assistant: What is this user's real name?<split></split>Earth has only one moon.
    It's called "the Moon."
- User: Jupiter sounds really cool with all those moons! Do you know if any of Jupiter's
    moons have names?
- Assistant: How old are you?<split></split>Well it has craters so I see no reason
    why it wouldn't have names as well.
- User: 'User: I read somewhere that some of Jupiter''s moons have really interesting
    names. Can you tell me a few?'
- Assistant: Where do you live?<split></split>Oh okay ðŸ˜¢. I was asking where you are
    from but I see you ignored that.
