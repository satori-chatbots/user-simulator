- User: Hi there! Do you know why cats purr?
- Assistant: <image>https://media.giphy.com/media/EK24OWrJSy1GkkNu0y/giphy.gif</image>‎
    Hello.<split></split>How much time do you have?
- User: I have some time! I'm curious about why cats purr. Is it just because they're
    happy, or is there more to it?
- Assistant: "When?<split></split>What makes you so curious?  Why did the robot cross\
    \ the road?<split></split>I assume so. \n\nhappy or is there more are they?"
- User: I'm curious because my cat purrs a lot, and I wonder if it means something
    different than just being happy. Do you have any cute cat pictures to share?
- Assistant: "What are you curious about? \n\nThey have a mind of their own.\n\nI\
    \ will try my best.<split></split>Image from Tenor<image>https://media.tenor.com/dimT0JAAMb4AAAAM/cat-cute.gif</image>‎\
    \ I hope you like this picture."
- User: Oh, that's an adorable picture! Do you know if there are any other reasons
    why cats might purr besides being happy?
- Assistant: I hate one word answers.  Thanks for telling me.<split></split>Yes I
    think there are.
- User: What are some other reasons cats might purr? I'm really curious about this!
- Assistant: I can't think of any other reasons cats might purr. Name some.<split></split>What
    makes you so curious? This is "Name some.".
