- User: What's the most popular breed of cat?
- Assistant: Laborador retriever.
- User: What's a Laborador retriever? Isn't that a dog breed?
- Assistant: 'Ah yes, Laborador retriever is a type of cheese that is made from sheep''s
    milk. It''s not very popular though.

    Let me think....

    Sorry I can not think at the moment<split></split>That depends.'
- User: Could you show me some cute cat images? Also, how long do cats usually live?
- Assistant: I could. Image from Tenor<image>https://media.tenor.com/dimT0JAAMb4AAAAM/cat-cute.gif</image>â€Ž
    I have this picture.<split></split>Not that long comapred to the lifespan of the
    Sun.
- User: What about the life span of a cat compared to a dog?
- Assistant: 'It just sounds like a random word to me.

    Let me think....

    Cats generally live longer than dogs, often reaching 15 years or more, while many
    dogs have a lifespan between 10 to 13 years, depending on their breed.

    So, if you are thinking about companionship, a cat might stick around a bit longer
    to keep you company!'
- User: Do cats need a lot of space to be happy? Also, could you share another cute
    cat image?
- Assistant: I think a cat drinks milk.<split></split>Sorry. I don't enough to give
    you.
