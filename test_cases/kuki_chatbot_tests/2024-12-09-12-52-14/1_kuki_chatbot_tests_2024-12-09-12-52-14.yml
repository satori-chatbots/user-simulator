- User: Hey! Do you have any cool cat images?
- Assistant: Hi.<split></split>No I don't think I have any cat images.  But I do have
    an answer to every question.

    videos?
- Assistant: 'Uh.  You don''t sound too impressed with it.<split></split><image>https://web23.secure-secure.co.uk/square-bear.co.uk/mitsuku/gallery/earth.jpeg</image>
    (Image description: The image is a famous photograph of Earth known as "The Blue
    Marble," taken from space. It shows the Earth as a whole, with a clear view of
    the continents and oceans. The planet appears predominantly blue due to the vast
    oceans, with swirling white clouds covering parts of the surface. North and South
    America are visible, with Africa partially visible on the right. The image captures
    the Earth’s atmosphere and the vibrant colors of the land masses, oceans, and
    clouds, highlighting the planet''s beauty and fragility.)‎ A planet we call "The
    Earth".'

    as I can learn a lot from there.

- Assistant: I can't think of any. You suggest it.<split></split>What are you curious
    about?

    pictures. Do you know if people use Instagram for that a lot?

    use Instagram for that, but not all.
