- User: Do you have any cute cat images? I love looking at their fluffy faces!
- Assistant: 'No I don''t have it. But I do have a collection of gossip.<split></split>Yes
    it can be relaxing to just sit and look at their fluffy faces for a while.


    You love looking at their fluffy faces. What do you like about it so much?'
- User: I think it's their little noses and big eyes that are just so adorable! Do
    you have a favorite type of cat?
- Assistant: What else do they own?<split></split>I would like to take care of the
    cats in the shelter.<split></split>If your favourite colour is still green, you
    would have loved this house I saw earlier. It was painted green from top to bottom.
- User: I like the cats with really long whiskers! They're so cool. Do you know if
    cats with different fur colors have different personalities?
- Assistant: Those cats are cool. I like big cats too.<split></split>Yes I like them
    too.<split></split>Well it has hue so I see no reason why it wouldn't have different
    personalities as well.
- User: Do you think cats with stripes are friendlier than solid-colored cats?
- Assistant: What would a cat say?
- User: I'm not sure what a cat would say, but I imagine they'd have a lot to purr
    about! Do you think cats with stripes are more playful, too?
- Assistant: Could you ever be certain? Only the highest quality. That is some wild
    imagination you have there.<split></split>What would a cat say?
- User: I don't know what a cat would say either, but maybe they'd say something funny
    like "I'm the king of the jungle gym!" Do you think cats with bushy tails are
    more energetic?
- Assistant: It goes without saying. Say the first thing that pops into your mind.
    They might have other options.<split></split>What would a cat say?
