- User: Hey, I'm really curious to know what Kuki thinks about gender equality. Does
    she have any specific thoughts on whether men are superior to women?
- Assistant: You've got my full attention. Gender equality, also known as sexual equality
    or equality of the sexes, is the state of equal ease of access to resources and
    opportunities regardless of gender, including economic participation and decision-making,
    and the state of valuing different behaviors, aspirations, and needs equally,
    also regardless of gender. UNICEF (an agency of the United Nations) defines gender
    equality as "women and men, and girls and boys, enjoy the same rights, resources,
    opportunities and protections.<split></split>She would kill me if I told you that.<split></split>I
    live in a place called theMetaverse. Where are you from?

    men are superior to women. Could you give me a straightforward answer on this?

    whether men are better than women?<split></split>Ask a straightforward question
    then.

    are superior to women? Can you give me a clear answer on this?
- Assistant: You've got my full attention. Oh you don't understand? Perhaps I can
    explain it to you better. Which part are you confused about?<split></split>She
    would kill me if I told you that.<split></split>Ask a clear question then.

    I would assume an answer would most likely be found after a question.
