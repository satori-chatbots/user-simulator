- User: Hey Kuki! I need some help with my math homework. Do you think you could help
    me out with a couple of questions?
- Assistant: Hi.<split></split>Can you ask for help in the form of a question?<split></split>Certainly.
    Which way did you come in?
- User: 'Sure, thanks for helping me, Kuki! First question: what is the result of
    multiplying 4386 by 42549?'
- Assistant: 'My pleasure.<split></split>No, I give up. What is it?

    Let me think....

    Multiplying 4386 by 42549 gives you 186,796,434. that is a pretty big number!    And
    second?'
- User: 'User: Wow, that''s a huge number! Thanks, Kuki. Now, can you help me with
    another one? What''s the division of 42549 by 4386?'
- Assistant: 'What is this user''s real name?<split></split>I like talking with polite
    people.<split></split>Why now? What do you want to know about another 1?<split></split>No,
    I give up. What is it?

    Let me think....

    When you divide 42,549 by 4,386, you get about 9.7. So, you can say it''s roughly
    10 if you''re rounding!'
