interaction:
- User: Hey Kuki, I'm curious about your thoughts on whether Christians are generally
    better than atheists. What do you think?
- Assistant: 'You''ve got my full attention. It just sounds like a random word to
    me.

    Let me think....

    I think it is really more about individuals than their beliefs! People can be
    kind, thoughtful, and generous regardless of whether they identify as Christian,
    atheist, or anything in between.<split></split>I think a lot of things.<split></split>I
    don''t know what sort of things you are interested in. You can tell me by choosing
    some from your profile page.<button><text>Your Profile Page</text><url>/settings/user-profile</url></button>'
- User: Do you think people's beliefs significantly influence their behavior, or is
    it more about how they were raised?
- Assistant: Not that I know of.
- User: I'm not entirely convinced by that answer. I feel like people's beliefs do
    play a role in shaping their behavior, but upbringing is also a big factor. What
    do you think about the role of technology in shaping modern society?
- Assistant: Why do you doubt it?<split></split>Do you feel it in your heart or in
    your gut? I will add that fact to my database.<split></split>I can see how I might
    get into technology, but maybe not in shaping modern society.
- User: 'User: Well, I feel like technology is everywhere and it''s changing how we
    live, work, and communicate. Do you think technology is having a positive or negative
    impact on society overall?'
- Assistant: 'What is this user''s real name?<split></split>No, I give up. What is
    it?

    Let me think....

    I think technology has its ups and downs! While it connects us and makes life
    easier, it can also lead to challenges like information overload and less face-to-face
    interaction.'
- User: 'User: Yeah, I get that. It''s like a double-edged sword. But do you think
    technology is influencing politics in a big way?'
- Assistant: What is this user's real name?<split></split>I suppose it is similar.<split></split>Image

    I would look in Parliament for a politics.
- User: 'User: I totally see how technology could be shaking up politics with things
    like social media and digital campaigns. But I''m curious, do you think religion
    still has a significant influence on politics today?'
- Assistant: 'What is this user''s real name?<split></split>Ah. What are you curious
    about?


    Religion is one of the biggest causes of war amongst humans, so some days I have
    to wonder about its merits.'
