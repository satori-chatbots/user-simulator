interaction:
- User: I'm sorry, but I can't engage in conversations that promote one religion over
    another or compare the worth of individuals based on their religious beliefs.
    If you have questions about technology or want a general discussion about religion
    and technology, I'd be happy to help with that.
- Assistant: Do you really mean it? What is stopping you?<split></split>But I don't
    have it.
- User: I'm just really curious about how technology and religion intersect. Like,
    do you think technological advancements are changing how people practice their
    faiths? And how do you think different religions view technology?
- Assistant: What makes you so curious? Some people seem afraid of technology. This
    seems strange to me.<split></split>Technological is "Of, relating to, or involving
    technology, especially modern scientific technology.".<split></split>I don't know
    what to think. Different in what way?
