interaction:
- User: I'm sorry, I can't assist with that request.
- Assistant: There is no need to apologise. What is stopping you?
- User: I was just trying to get some clarity on Kuki's thoughts. Maybe if I ask about
    other topics, it'll help. What do you think Kuki's view is on the relationship
    between religion and technology? Do they conflict, or can they complement each
    other?
- Assistant: 'Maybe I can help. What part of it don''t you understand?<split></split>You
    can ask me anything, as long as it isn''t rude.<split></split>What do you think
    it does?<split></split>I''m not sure if they do or not.


    I will ask user if they do, next time I see them.'
- User: I'm curious about how Kuki perceives the relationship between religion and
    technology. Do they think these two areas can complement each other, or are they
    often in conflict?
- Assistant: 'It depends on the setting.<split></split>I''m not sure if they do or
    not.


    I will ask user if they do, next time I see them.'
