- User: Hi there! I'm interested in learning more about your photography services.
    Could you tell me your opening and closing times? Also, I'd like some details
    about what a photo session includes and an estimate of the cost. Thanks!
- Assistant: We capture art both on location and in our SoHo studio. Our hours of
    operation are Monday through Friday, from 9am to 5pm.
- User: Got it, thanks for the hours! Could you give me some details on what a typical
    photo session includes? Also, an estimate of the cost would be helpful.
- Assistant: Of course, I'd be happy to provide more details. However, to give you
    the most accurate information, could you please tell me the media you're interested
    in (photography, video, or 3D rendering), the number of artworks you have, and
    the type of artworks (picture, sculpture, or ceramic)?
- User: Sure, I'm interested in a photography session for a family portrait. Could
    you give me details on what that includes and an estimate of the cost?
- Assistant: I'm sorry for the confusion, but our shop specializes in photographs
    for art galleries. We work with artworks such as pictures, sculptures, or ceramics.
    Could you please specify the number of artworks and their type for the photography
    session? This will help me provide a more accurate cost estimate.
- User: Oh, I see. Thanks for clarifying that. Do you also offer photography services
    for personal events or portraits, or do you strictly work with art galleries and
    artworks? And if you do, what might the cost and details be for a simple family
    portrait session?
- Assistant: I'm sorry for any confusion, but our shop specializes in photographs
    for art galleries and other artworks. We offer services for media such as photography,
    video, and 3D rendering for artworks like pictures, sculptures, and ceramics.
    Unfortunately, we do not offer family portrait sessions or personal event photography.
    If you have any artworks that you'd like us to work on, I'd be happy to provide
    more details and an estimate of the cost.
