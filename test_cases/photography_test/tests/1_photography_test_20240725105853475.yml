- User: Hi there! I'm interested in getting some photos taken of a few artworks. Could
    you tell me what services you offer for art photography?
- Assistant: Primarily on photos, but also on videos and virtual/3D renderings.
- User: That's great! I'm mainly interested in high-quality photos. Can you provide
    me with an estimate for photographing four artworks?
- Assistant: Of course, I'd be happy to help you with that. You've mentioned that
    you're interested in photography for four artworks. Could you please specify the
    type of artworks? Are they pictures, sculptures, or ceramics?
- User: They are paintings. Each one is around 24x36 inches.
- Assistant: I see, thank you for the information. However, for our estimation, we
    categorize paintings under the 'picture' category. So, to confirm, you're interested
    in photography for four pictures, correct?
- User: Yes, that's correct. Four paintings. Could you give me a ballpark figure on
    the cost for that?
- Assistant: 'Thanks {name} for giving those details!.

    The cost would be approximately $200, but it could vary based on other factors
    such as the size of the artworks.

- User: Got it, thanks for the estimate. What does that $200 include? For example,
    does it cover basic editing or any touch-ups?
- Assistant: I am unsure, but I can provide information about our opening hours, shop
    location, portfolio, pricing model, and the types of media we work with.
- User: Could you clarify what that $200 includes? For example, does it cover basic
    editing or any touch-ups?
- Assistant: I understand that you have four paintings that you'd like to have photographed.
    However, I need to clarify a few things to provide you with the most accurate
    information. Could you please confirm that the media you're interested in is photography?
