- User: 'Hi there! I''d like to place an order for a pizza. Can I get a large pizza
    with pepperoni, please?


    Actually, you know what? Make it a medium instead of a large. And could you also
    add mushrooms to that?


    Oh, and do you have any garlic dipping sauce?'
- Assistant: I'm sorry for the confusion, but we only offer small, medium, and big
    sizes for our pizzas. You've mentioned medium, so I'll take that as your choice.
    Is that correct?
- User: Oh, I see. Yes, medium is fine. Could you add mushrooms to the pepperoni,
    please? And do you have any garlic dipping sauce available?
- Assistant: 'We appreciate your order for a medium pizza!

    Of course, we can add mushrooms to your pepperoni pizza. However, I need to confirm
    the toppings for your pizza. You''ve mentioned pepperoni and mushrooms. Would
    you like to add any other toppings from the following: cheese, pepper, ham, bacon,
    olives, corn, chicken?'
