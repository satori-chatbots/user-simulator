    let me know how long it will take for delivery, please?

    in small, medium, and big sizes. Could you please specify your preferred size?

    Sure, I''ve noted down your preference for a big pizza. You''ve already chosen
    mushrooms as a topping. Would you like to add any other toppings such as cheese,
    pepper, ham, bacon, pepperoni, olives, corn, or chicken?'
