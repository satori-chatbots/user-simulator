- User: I'd like to order an extra large pizza with tomato, can you tell me the price
    and estimated delivery time, and do you have any special deals or discounts available?
- Assistant: I'm sorry, but we only offer small, medium, and big sizes for our pizzas.
    Could you please specify which size you would like for your pizza?
- User: Okay, I'll go with the big size then, can you tell me the price and estimated
    delivery time for a big pizza with tomato, and let me know if there are any special
    deals or discounts available?
- Assistant: 'Thank you for placing an order for a large pizza!

    Of course, I can help with that. However, I need to know what toppings you would
    like on your pizza. We have cheese, mushrooms, pepper, ham, bacon, pepperoni,
    olives, corn, and chicken. Could you please specify your choice?'
