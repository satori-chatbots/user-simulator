- User: Hello there! For my order today, I'm interested in getting a pizza, and I'm
    thinking about a small size. Could you tell me more about the options available
    for such a pizza? I would love to hear about the crust choices, the variety of
    sauces, and if there are any special deals or combinations that come with a small
    pizza. Additionally, I am quite fond of onions, so I would like to know if you
    can add them as a topping. Could you also let me know if there are any other toppings
    that pair well with onions? I want to make the most delicious pizza possible!
    Thank you so much!
- Assistant: I see that you've already chosen a small size for your pizza. That's
    great! Now, let's move on to the next step of your order.
- User: 'What options do you have for the crust? I am particularly interested in knowing
    if you offer a thin crust, deep-dish, or perhaps a gluten-free variety. Additionally,
    can you tell me about the sauce choices available for a small pizza? Iâ€™m curious
    if there are any unique or house-special sauces that could make the pizza extra
    delicious.


    As for the onions, I definitely want them as a topping, but could you recommend
    other toppings that complement onions well? I am thinking about creating a flavor
    combination that is both delightful and unique. For instance, do you think mushrooms,
    bell peppers, or maybe even a certain type of cheese would go well with onions?
    I can''t wait to hear your suggestions and finalize my order!'
- Assistant: 'We appreciate your order for a small pizza!

    I''m sorry for the confusion, but we currently only offer the following toppings:
    cheese, mushrooms, pepper, ham, bacon, pepperoni, olives, corn, and chicken. Unfortunately,
    we do not offer onions as a topping. Could you please choose your toppings from
    the list provided?'
