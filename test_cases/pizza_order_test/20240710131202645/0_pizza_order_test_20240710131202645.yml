- User: Hi there, can I please order a medium pizza with olives? Also, could you tell
    me what the total cost would be and how long the delivery will take?
- Assistant: Hi there! I see you've already chosen a medium pizza. That's great! We're
    all set with the size of your pizza.
- User: Yes, that's correct. Can you let me know if there are any extra charges for
    the olives and if there are any current deals or discounts available? Also, what
    are your payment options?
- Assistant: 'We appreciate your order for a medium pizza!

    Of course, I can help with that. But before we proceed, could you please confirm
    the toppings you''d like on your pizza? You can choose from cheese, mushrooms,
    pepper, ham, bacon, pepperoni, olives, corn, and chicken.'
