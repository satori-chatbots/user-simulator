- Assistant: 'We appreciate your order for a medium pizza!

    I''m glad to hear you''re excited about your pizza! However, I''m sorry but we
    don''t have tomatoes as a topping option. We do have cheese, mushrooms, pepper,
    ham, bacon, pepperoni, olives, corn, and chicken. Could you please choose from
    these options? As for the special offers, I''m afraid I don''t have that information
    right now. I suggest you check our website or call our shop for the latest deals
    and discounts.'
