- User: Hello! I was thinking about ordering a pizza today. Could you possibly tell
    me if you have any large pizzas available? I'm really craving something delicious
    and substantial, and I'd love to know my options. Also, could you inform me if
    one of the available toppings is pepperoni? I'm a huge fan of pepperoni, and it
    would make my day to have that on my pizza.
- Assistant: Hello! We certainly have large pizzas available and pepperoni is one
    of our popular toppings. However, to confirm your order, could you please specify
    the size of the pizza you'd like? The options are small, medium, or big.
- User: Thank you for confirming that you have large pizzas available. I'd definitely
    like to go with a large pizza. And it's wonderful to hear that pepperoni is one
    of the available toppings. Could you also let me know if there are any other topping
    options available? I might want to add a couple more to make my pizza even more
    delightful.
- Assistant: 'Thank you for placing an order for a large pizza!

    Of course! Apart from pepperoni, we also offer cheese, mushrooms, pepper, ham,
    bacon, olives, corn, and chicken as toppings. You can choose any combination of
    these. Could you please specify which additional toppings you''d like on your
    large pizza?'
