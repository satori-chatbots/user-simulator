- User: Hi there, can I please order a small pizza with olives? Also, could you let
    me know the total price and the estimated delivery time?
- Assistant: Hi there! I see that you've already chosen a small pizza. Is there anything
    else you would like to add to your order?
- User: Can I also get a side of garlic bread with that and a bottle of water?
- Assistant: Of course, I've added a side of garlic bread and a bottle of water to
    your order. Now, let's confirm the size of your pizza. You've chosen a small pizza,
    is that correct?
- User: Yes, that's correct, a small pizza with olives, a side of garlic bread, and
    a bottle of water; could you please tell me the total price and the estimated
    delivery time?
- Assistant: 'We appreciate your order for a small pizza!

    Of course, I can help with that. However, I noticed that you''ve only chosen olives
    as a topping for your pizza. Would you like to add any other toppings such as
    cheese, mushrooms, pepper, ham, bacon, pepperoni, corn, or chicken?'
