- User: Hello there! I hope you're doing well today; I'm interested in ordering an
    extra large pizza with just cheese, but I also wanted to check if you have any
    special deals or discounts available right now for such an order because I'd love
    to take advantage of any promotions you might be running, and could you also let
    me know the total cost including taxes and delivery fees if applicable?
- Assistant: I'm glad to hear you're interested in ordering a pizza! However, we only
    offer small, medium, and big sizes. Could you please specify which one you'd prefer?
- User: I understand that you don't have an extra large size, so in that case, I'd
    like to order a big pizza with just cheese; however, I still want to know if you
    have any special deals or discounts available at the moment that I might be able
    to take advantage of, and could you also let me know the total cost including
    any taxes and delivery fees if they apply, and by the way, do you have any recommendations
    for sides or drinks that might go well with a cheese pizza?
- Assistant: 'Thank you for placing an order for a large pizza!

    Thank you for your order. You''ve mentioned that you''d like a big pizza with
    cheese. Just to confirm, would you like any additional toppings such as mushrooms,
    pepper, ham, bacon, pepperoni, olives, corn, or chicken?'
- User: No, I only want the big pizza with cheese, but I still need to know if there
    are any current special deals or discounts I might be able to use for this order;
    could you please also tell me the total cost including taxes and delivery fees
    if there are any, and do you have any recommendations for sides or drinks that
    would pair well with a cheese pizza, as I might consider adding something else
    to my order if there are good options available?
- Assistant: 'Great, a pizza with cheese!

    Of course, I understand your request. As for the drinks, we have coke, sprite,
    and water. Which one would you prefer to accompany your big cheese pizza?'
