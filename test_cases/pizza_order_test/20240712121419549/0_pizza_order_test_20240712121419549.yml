    I''m glad to hear you''re interested in our big pizza! However, I noticed that
    you mentioned tomatoes as a topping. Unfortunately, we don''t offer tomatoes as
    a topping. Our available toppings are cheese, mushrooms, pepper, ham, bacon, pepperoni,
    olives, corn, and chicken. Could you please specify your preferred toppings from
    this list?'

    Of course, we can add mushrooms and olives to your big pizza. As for the price
    and any ongoing specials or discounts, I would need to check that for you. In
    the meantime, could you please let me know what drink you would like with your
