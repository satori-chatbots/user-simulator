- User: Hi there! I was wondering if I could place an order for a pizza, and I have
    a few specific preferences that I’d like to share. Firstly, I’m looking for a
    pizza that’s just the right size, not too big and not too small, so a small one
    would be perfect. Now, when it comes to toppings, I have a particular fondness
    for olives, so I’d love to include some olives on it. Could you please confirm
    if you have that available and if there’s anything else I might need to know?
- Assistant: Thank you for your order. You mentioned that you want a small pizza with
    olives. Can you please confirm the size of the pizza?
- User: Ah, yes, I can definitely confirm that I’d like a small pizza. I just want
    to make sure it’s the right size for a single meal. And just to reiterate, having
    olives as the topping is an absolute must for me. While we’re discussing this,
    could you also let me know if there are any other topping options that work well
    with olives? I’m open to adding a few more if they would complement the taste.
- Assistant: 'We appreciate your order for a small pizza!

    Absolutely, we can prepare a small pizza with olives for you. As for other toppings
    that pair well with olives, you might consider cheese, mushrooms, or ham. Would
    you like to add any of these to your pizza?'
- User: That sounds fantastic! I'd love to explore some additional toppings to complement
    those delightful olives. Cheese is always a classic choice, so definitely add
    that. Mushrooms could be an interesting addition as well, bringing in that earthy
    flavor. However, I'm not too sure about ham; I think I'll pass on that one. So,
    to summarize, I’d like a small pizza with olives, cheese, and mushrooms. Could
    you also let me know if there are any special sauces or seasonings that could
    enhance the flavors of these toppings? I'm always looking to try something new
    and delicious!
- Assistant: 'Great, a pizza with [''olives'', ''cheese'', ''mushrooms'']!

    Absolutely, we can prepare a small pizza with olives, cheese, and mushrooms for
    you. As for sauces or seasonings, we have a variety of options like garlic sauce,
    hot sauce, or Italian seasoning that could enhance the flavors of your pizza.
    Now, could you please let me know what you would like to drink with your pizza?
    We offer coke, sprite, and water.'
