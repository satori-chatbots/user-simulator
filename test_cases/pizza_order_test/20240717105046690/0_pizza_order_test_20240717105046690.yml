- User: Hi there! I'd like to place an order for a large pizza, and I'm really curious
    about the options available when it comes to toppings, specifically if you offer
    fresh tomato as one of the choices, and if so, I'd like to know if the tomatoes
    are sourced locally or if they're of a specific variety, plus do you offer any
    special deals or discounts on large pizzas right now, and could you also tell
    me about your crust options because I prefer a crispy crust, and lastly, what's
    the estimated delivery time for my area?
- Assistant: I'm sorry for the confusion, but we only offer small, medium, and big
    sizes for our pizzas. Could you please specify which size you would like for your
    order?
- User: Oh, I see, I appreciate the clarification, so in that case, I'd like to order
    a big pizza, and Iâ€™m still very much interested in knowing about the toppings,
    especially if you have fresh tomato and whether those tomatoes are locally sourced
    or of a particular variety, as well as any current special deals or discounts
    you might have on big pizzas, additionally, I'd love to hear about your different
    crust options since a crispy crust is my preference, and lastly, could you provide
    an estimated delivery time for my specific area?
- Assistant: 'Thank you for placing an order for a large pizza!

    I''m glad to hear you''re interested in our big pizza! As for the toppings, we
    offer cheese, mushrooms, pepper, ham, bacon, pepperoni, olives, corn, and chicken.
    Unfortunately, we do not offer fresh tomato as a topping. Could you please specify
    which toppings you would like for your pizza?'
