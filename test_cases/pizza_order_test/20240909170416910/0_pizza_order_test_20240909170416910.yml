- User: Hi, I'd like to order a pizza. Do you have a big size available?
- Assistant: Of course, we do have big size pizzas. So, you would like to order a
    big size pizza, correct?
- User: Yes, that's right. Can I get a pizza with tomato and olives?
- Assistant: 'Thank you for placing an order for a large pizza!

    Sure, we can add olives to your pizza. However, tomato is not on our list of toppings.
    We have cheese, mushrooms, pepper, ham, bacon, pepperoni, corn, and chicken. Could
    you please choose from these options?'
- User: Can you add cheese and onions to my pizza, then?
- Assistant: 'I''m sorry, but onions are not on our list of toppings. We can definitely
    add cheese to your pizza. Could you please choose another topping from the following
    options: mushrooms, pepper, ham, bacon, pepperoni, corn, chicken, or olives?'
- User: Alright, in that case, can I get mushrooms added to my pizza along with the
    cheese and olives?
- Assistant: 'Great, a pizza with [''cheese'', ''olives'', ''mushrooms'']!

    Absolutely, we can add mushrooms, cheese, and olives to your pizza. Now, could
    you please tell me what drink you would like to have with your pizza? We have
    coke, sprite, and water available.'
- User: Sure, I'll take a Coke with that. How long is it going to take for the pizza
    to arrive?
- Assistant: 'Alright, your order for coke has been acknowledged. Have a great time
    with your pizza and beverages!

    Alright, your order for coke has been acknowledged. Have a great time with your
    pizza and beverages!'
- User: Thank you! But could you let me know how long it will take for the pizza to
    arrive?
- Assistant: I'm sorry it's a little loud in my pizza shop, can you say that again?
