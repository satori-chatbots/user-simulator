- User: "Hi there! I'd like to order a pizza. \n\nDo you have small sizes available?"
- Assistant: Yes, we do have small sizes available. So, would you like to order a
    small size pizza?
- User: Great, I'd like a small pizza. Do you have pepperoni as a topping?
- Assistant: 'We appreciate your order for a small pizza!

    Yes, we do have pepperoni as a topping. So, you would like a small pizza with
    pepperoni topping, correct?'
- User: Yes, that's correct. Do you also have cheese as a topping?
- Assistant: Yes, we do have cheese as a topping. So, to confirm, you would like a
    small pizza with pepperoni and cheese toppings, correct?
- User: That's right. Do you have onions as a topping too?
- Assistant: I'm sorry, but we don't have onions as a topping. We have cheese, mushrooms,

    any of these to your pizza?
- User: Yes, I'd like to add mushrooms as well.
- Assistant: 'Great, a pizza with mushrooms!

    Perfect, your pizza order is coming along nicely. Now, could you please let me
    know what you would like to drink? We have coke, sprite, and water available.'

    you have tomatoes as a topping?
- Assistant: I'm sorry, but we don't have tomatoes as a topping. We have cheese, mushrooms,
    pepper, ham, bacon, pepperoni, olives, corn, and chicken. Would you like to add
