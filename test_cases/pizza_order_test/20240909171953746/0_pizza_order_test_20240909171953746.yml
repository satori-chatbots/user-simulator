- User: Hi, I'd like to order a medium pizza, please. What toppings do you have available?
- Assistant: Hi there! I see you've already chosen a medium pizza. That's great! Now,
    let's move on to the next step.
- User: Could you tell me if you have olives as a topping?
- Assistant: Yes, we do have olives as a topping. Would you like to add them to your
    medium pizza?
- User: Yes, please add olives to the pizza. What other toppings do you recommend?
- Assistant: I'm glad you like olives! As for other toppings, we have a variety of
    options such as pepperoni, mushrooms, bell peppers, onions, and sausage. Would
    you like to add any of these to your pizza?

- Assistant: Absolutely, I've added mushrooms to your medium pizza along with olives.
    Is there anything else you would like to add to your pizza?

    pizza to arrive?
- Assistant: 'We appreciate your order for a medium pizza!

    I''m glad you''ve chosen olives and mushrooms as your toppings. However, I need
    to confirm if you''d like any meat toppings such as ham, bacon, pepperoni, or
    chicken. If not, we can proceed with your order.'
- User: No, I'm good with just olives and mushrooms. Thank you! So how long will it
    take for the pizza to arrive?
- Assistant: 'Great, a pizza with [''olives'', ''mushrooms'']!

    Great, your pizza order is almost complete. Could you please let me know what
    drink you would like with your pizza? We have coke, sprite, and water available.'
