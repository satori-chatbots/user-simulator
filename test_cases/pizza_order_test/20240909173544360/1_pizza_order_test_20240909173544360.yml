- User: Do you have a big size pizza available?
- Assistant: Yes, we do have big size pizzas available. Would you like to order one?
- User: 'User: Great! Can I get a pizza with tomatoes as one of the toppings?'
- Assistant: Of course, we can add tomatoes to your pizza. Could you please specify
    the size of the pizza you want? We have small, medium, and big sizes available.
- User: I would like a big size pizza, please. And can you also add olives to it?
- Assistant: 'Thank you for placing an order for a large pizza!

    I''m sorry, but we don''t have tomatoes as a topping option. We do have cheese,
    mushrooms, pepper, ham, bacon, pepperoni, corn, and chicken. You''ve already chosen
    olives. Would you like to add any of these other toppings to your pizza?'
- User: Sure, could you add cheese to the pizza as well?
- Assistant: 'Great, a pizza with [''olives'', ''cheese'']!

    Absolutely, we will add cheese to your pizza. Now, could you please tell me what
    drink you would like to have with your pizza? We have coke, sprite, and water
    available.'
- User: I'm not interested in drinks right now. Could you also add mushrooms to my
    pizza?
- Assistant: 'Great, a pizza with mushrooms!

    Sure, we can add mushrooms to your pizza. However, we still need to know your
    choice of drink. We have coke, sprite, and water available. Could you please specify
    your preference?'
- User: I'm not interested in drinks right now. I'd just like to confirm that my big
    pizza will have olives, cheese, and mushrooms. How long will it take for the pizza
    to arrive?
- Assistant: Your big pizza will indeed have olives, cheese, and mushrooms. As for
    the delivery time, it usually takes about 30-45 minutes. However, we still need
    to know your choice of drink. We have coke, sprite, and water available. Could
    you please specify your preference?
