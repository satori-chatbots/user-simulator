- User: Hi! I'd like to order a pizza. Do you have medium-sized pizzas available?
- Assistant: Of course, we do have medium-sized pizzas. So, you would like to order
    a medium-sized pizza, correct?
- User: Yes, that's right. Can I have onions and mushrooms on it, please?
- Assistant: 'We appreciate your order for a medium pizza!

    I''m sorry, but we don''t have onions as a topping option. We do have mushrooms,
    though. You can choose from cheese, mushrooms, pepper, ham, bacon, pepperoni,
    olives, corn, and chicken. What other toppings would you like on your pizza?'
- User: Okay, I'll go with mushrooms and olives, then. Does that work?
- Assistant: 'Great, a pizza with [''mushrooms'', ''olives'']!

    Absolutely, we can prepare your pizza with mushrooms and olives. Now, could you
    please tell me what you would like to drink with your pizza? We have coke, sprite,
    and water available.'
