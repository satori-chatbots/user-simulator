- User: Hi, Iâ€™d like to order a big pizza, please.
- Assistant: Hi there! I see you've mentioned you want a big pizza. Just to confirm,
    is 'big' the size of the pizza you'd like to order?
- User: Yes, that's correct. Could I get tomato as one of the toppings, please?
- Assistant: 'Thank you for placing an order for a large pizza!

    I''m sorry, but we don''t have tomato as a topping option. You can choose from
    cheese, mushrooms, pepper, ham, bacon, pepperoni, olives, corn, or chicken. Could
    you please specify your preferred toppings from these options?'
- User: Alright, I'll go with mushrooms, please.
- Assistant: 'Great, a pizza with mushrooms!

    Great choice, mushrooms are a popular topping. Now, could you please tell me what
    you''d like to drink with your pizza? We have coke, sprite, and water available.'
