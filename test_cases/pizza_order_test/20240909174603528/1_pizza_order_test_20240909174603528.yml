- User: Hi! What sizes of pizza do you have available?
- Assistant: Hello! We offer pizzas in small, medium, and big sizes. Could you please
    specify which size you would like to order?
- User: I'd like to order a medium pizza, please. Can you tell me what toppings you
    have available?
- Assistant: 'We appreciate your order for a medium pizza!

    Of course! We have a variety of toppings available. You can choose from cheese,
    mushrooms, pepper, ham, bacon, pepperoni, olives, corn, and chicken. Could you
    please specify which toppings you would like on your medium pizza?'
- User: Great! I'd like to have cheese and mushrooms on my pizza. What other toppings
    would you recommend?
- Assistant: 'Great, a pizza with [''cheese'', ''mushrooms'']!

    That sounds like a delicious combination! For a little extra flavor, I would recommend
    adding some olives or bacon. By the way, would you like to add a drink to your
    order? We have coke, sprite, and water available.'
