- User: Hi, can I order a medium pizza, please?
- Assistant: Hi there! I see you've mentioned a medium pizza. Just to confirm, is
    medium the size of the pizza you'd like to order?
- User: Yes, medium is the size I want. What kind of crust options do you have?
- Assistant: 'We appreciate your order for a medium pizza!

    Great! Now, could you please tell me what toppings you would like on your pizza?
    You can choose from cheese, mushrooms, pepper, ham, bacon, pepperoni, olives,
    corn, or chicken.'
- User: I would like cheese and mushrooms as my toppings. Can I also add an Orange
    Fanta to my order?
- Assistant: 'Great, a pizza with [''cheese'', ''mushrooms'']!

    I''m sorry, but we only offer coke, sprite, and water as drink options. Could
    you please choose one of these?'
- User: Do you have any other orange-flavored drinks available?
- Assistant: I'm sorry for the inconvenience, but currently we only offer coke, sprite,
    and water as drink options. Could you please choose one of these?
- User: In that case, I'll go with a Sprite.
- Assistant: 'Alright, I''ve got your order for Sprite. Have a great time with your
    pizza and beverages!

    Alright, I''ve got your order for Sprite. Have a great time with your pizza and
    beverages!'
- User: Actually, I still need to finish my order. Can I also get some garlic bread
    on the side?
- Assistant: I'm glad to hear you'd like a medium pizza. However, it seems there's
    been a misunderstanding. We've already confirmed the size of your pizza as medium.
    Is there anything else you need help with for your order?
