- User: Hi there! I'd like to start by ordering a big pizza. What sizes do you offer?
- Assistant: Hi! You've already chosen a big pizza, which is one of the sizes we offer.
    We also have small and medium sizes. Can you please confirm that you want a big
    pizza?
- User: Yes, I confirm that I want a big pizza. What types of drinks do you have?
- Assistant: 'Thank you for placing an order for a large pizza!

    Great, a big pizza it is! Now, could you please tell me what toppings you would
    like on your pizza? You can choose from cheese, mushrooms, pepper, ham, bacon,
    pepperoni, olives, corn, and chicken.'
- User: Sure, I'd like to add cheese and pepperoni. Also, do you have Orange Fanta?
- Assistant: 'Great, a pizza with [''cheese'', ''pepperoni'']!

    I''m sorry, but we only offer coke, sprite, and water as drink options. Could
    you please choose one of these?'
- User: Oh, I see. In that case, I'll go with a Coke. Can I also add mushrooms to
    the pizza?
- Assistant: 'Alright, your order for coke has been acknowledged. Have a great time
    with your pizza and beverages!

    Alright, your order for coke has been acknowledged. Have a great time with your
    pizza and beverages!'
- User: Sure, thanks! Can I also add bacon to the pizza?
- Assistant: I'm glad to hear that you've confirmed your choice of a big pizza. However,
    I noticed that you mentioned adding bacon to the pizza, which is not related to
    the size of the pizza. Can we focus on finalizing the size of your pizza first?
    You've already chosen a big pizza, is that correct?
- User: Yes, that's correct, I've already chosen a big pizza. Now, can I add bacon
    to the toppings along with cheese, pepperoni, and mushrooms?
- Assistant: 'Thank you for placing an order for a large pizza!

    Absolutely, you can add bacon to your pizza. So, your toppings are cheese, pepperoni,
    mushrooms, and bacon. Is that correct?'
