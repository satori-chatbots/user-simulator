- User: 'Hi, I''d like to order a medium custom pizza with cheese. Do you offer Sprite
    as a drink?


    '
- Assistant: Sprite and Coke are 1.50$. Water is 1$.
- User: Great, I'd like to add a Sprite to my order. How much will the medium custom
    pizza with cheese cost?
- Assistant: Margarita pizzas are 10$ for small, 15$ for medium and 20$ for big. The
    other predefined pizzas, except for carbonara are 2$ more for each size. Carbonara
    is 2.5$ more for each size. Custom pizzas with up to three ingredients are the
    same prices than predefined ones. Each additional ingredient has an increment
    of 50 cents.
- User: Thank you! So, my total is $15 for the medium custom pizza with cheese and
    $1.50 for the Sprite, making it $16.50, right? How long will it take for the pizza
    to arrive?
- Assistant: It depends on the number of pizzas of the order, typically around 15
    minutes per pizza, but depends on how busy we are.
- User: That works for me. Can you give me an estimated delivery time for my order?

    minutes per pizza, but depends on how busy we are.
- User: I understand. If you could provide a rough estimate based on your current
    workload, that would be really helpful.

- User: Could you please check with the kitchen and give me an estimated delivery
    time for my order?
- Assistant: It depends on the number of pizzas of the order, typically around 15
    minutes per pizza, but depends on how busy we are.

    your current workload? Thank you.
