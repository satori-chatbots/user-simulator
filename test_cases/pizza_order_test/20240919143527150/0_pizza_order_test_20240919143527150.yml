    pepperoni, and onion on that?


    Also, do you have Orange Fanta?'
- Assistant: 'I see you would like to order a small custom pizza. However, we don''t
    have onion as a topping option. Could you please choose from the following toppings:
    cheese, mushrooms, pepper, ham, bacon, pepperoni, olives, corn, or chicken?'
- User: Oh, I see. In that case, I'll go with cheese, olives, pepperoni, and mushrooms
    instead. Is that okay? And do you have Orange Fanta available?
- Assistant: 'Thanks for ordering a small pizza with cheese, olives, pepperoni and
    mushrooms!

    water?'
