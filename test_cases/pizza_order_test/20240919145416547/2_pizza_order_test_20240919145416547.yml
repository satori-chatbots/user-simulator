    pepperoni, ham, mushrooms, egg, cheese, and olives?
- Assistant: "It looks like there are some issues with your previous order details.\
    \ The size \"big\" is not available, and some of the toppings like \"onion\" and\
    \ \"egg\" are not on our menu. \n\nCould you please choose a pizza size from small,\
    \ medium, or large? Also, please select from the following toppings: cheese, mushrooms,\
    \ pepper, ham, bacon, pepperoni, olives, corn, chicken."

    ham, mushrooms, cheese, and olives.

    cheese and olives!

- User: Can I get an Orange Fanta instead of the options you mentioned?

    you please choose one of these options for your drink? Also, let me know how many
    drinks you would like.

    large pizza and the Coke?
