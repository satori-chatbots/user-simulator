- User: Hi, Iâ€™d like to order a small custom pizza. Can I get bacon and mushrooms
    on it?
- Assistant: I see that you've chosen bacon and mushrooms as your toppings. Could
    you please confirm the size of your pizza? The available sizes are small, medium,
    and large.
- User: Yes, I want a small pizza. Can I also add ham and egg to it?
- Assistant: 'Thanks for ordering a small pizza with bacon, mushrooms and ham!

    Thank you for confirming the size and toppings for your pizza. Could you please
    let me know how many drinks you would like to order and which drinks you prefer?
    The available options are coke, sprite, and water.'
- User: Can I also add cheese, pepperoni, and olives to the pizza? And do you have
    Orange Fanta as a drink option?
- Assistant: 'Unfortunately, we do not have Orange Fanta as a drink option. The available
    drink options are coke, sprite, and water. Could you please let me know which
    drink you would like and how many drinks you would like to order?


    Regarding your pizza, we currently offer predefined pizza types. Here are the
    available options: margarita, carbonara, marinera, hawaiian, four cheese, and
    vegetarian. Could you please choose one of these types and confirm the size as
    small?'
- User: I really want a custom pizza, not a predefined one. Is it possible to get
    that with bacon, mushrooms, ham, egg, cheese, pepperoni, and olives? And I'll
    go with a Coke for my drink.
- Assistant: 'Sure, I''ve received your order for one Coke.

    The cost of a small pizza topped with bacon, mushrooms, and ham, along with one
    Coke, is $11.50.

- User: 'Can I get the total cost for the pizza with all the toppings I''ve asked
    for: bacon, mushrooms, ham, egg, cheese, pepperoni, and olives?'
- Assistant: Margarita pizzas are 10$ for small, 15$ for medium and 20$ for big. The
    other predefined pizzas, except for carbonara are 2$ more for each size. Carbonara
    is 2.5$ more for each size. Custom pizzas with up to three ingredients are the
    same prices than predefined ones. Each additional ingredient has an increment
    of 50 cents.
