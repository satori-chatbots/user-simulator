- User: Hello! I'd like to order a medium custom pizza. Can I have egg, bacon, and
    ham on it?
- Assistant: It looks like you have chosen a medium pizza. However, "egg" is not an
    available topping. The available toppings are cheese, mushrooms, pepper, ham,
    bacon, pepperoni, olives, corn, and chicken. Could you please choose from these
    toppings?
- User: Got it! Let's go with bacon, ham, cheese, and pepperoni then.
- Assistant: 'Thanks for ordering a medium pizza with bacon, ham, cheese and pepperoni!

    Thank you for updating your toppings to bacon, ham, cheese, and pepperoni. Could
    you please let me know how many drinks you would like to order and which drinks
    you prefer? The available options are coke, sprite, and water.'
- User: Do you have Orange Fanta by any chance?
- Assistant: I'm sorry, but we only have coke, sprite, and water available. Could
    you please let me know how many drinks you would like to order and which one you
    prefer?
- User: I'll take one Coke, please. How much will the total be for the pizza and the
    drink?
- Assistant: 'Sure, I''ve received your order for one Coke.

    The cost of a medium pizza topped with bacon, ham, cheese, and pepperoni, along
    with one Coke, is $17.00.
