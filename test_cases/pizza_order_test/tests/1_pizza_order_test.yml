- User: Can I get a small pizza with cheese, mushrooms, tomato, onion, and olives,
    please? How much will that be?
- Assistant: I see that you've already mentioned that you'd like a small pizza. Is
    there anything else you would like to add to your order?
- User: No, that's all. What's the total cost for the pizza?
- Assistant: 'We appreciate your order for a small pizza!

    I''m sorry for the confusion, but we only offer the following toppings: cheese,
    mushrooms, pepper, ham, bacon, pepperoni, olives, corn, and chicken. You''ve already
    chosen cheese, mushrooms, and olives. Could you please revise your toppings selection?'
- User: In that case, Iâ€™ll go with cheese, mushrooms, onions, and olives. How much
    will that be?
- Assistant: 'I''m sorry for the confusion, but we don''t offer onions as a topping.
    We only offer the following toppings: cheese, mushrooms, pepper, ham, bacon, pepperoni,
    olives, corn, and chicken. You''ve already chosen cheese, mushrooms, and olives.
    Could you please revise your toppings selection?'
- User: Alright, I'll have cheese, mushrooms, olives, and pepper. What's the total
    cost for that?
- Assistant: 'Great, a pizza with [''cheese'', ''mushrooms'', ''olives'', ''pepper'']!

    Great choice on the toppings! Now, would you like to add a drink to your order?
    We offer coke, sprite, and water.'
- User: No, I'm good with just the pizza. What's the total cost for that?
- Assistant: I understand. Let me calculate the total for your small pizza with cheese,
    mushrooms, olives, and pepper. Please wait a moment.
