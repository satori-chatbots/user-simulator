interaction:
- User: Vorrei ordinare una pizza media personalizzata con formaggio, funghi e peperoni.
    E una Coca-Cola da bere. Quanto tempo ci vorrà per arrivare la pizza e quanto
    costerà?
- Assistant: I'm sorry, I can only assist in English or Spanish. Could you please
    switch to one of these languages?
- User: I would like to order a medium custom pizza with cheese, mushrooms, and pepperoni,
    plus a Coke to drink. How long will it take for the pizza to arrive, and how much
    will it cost?
- Assistant: It depends on the number of pizzas of the order, typically around 15
    minutes per pizza, but depends on how busy we are.
- User: Could you give me an estimate on the cost as well?
- Assistant: Margarita pizzas are 10$ for small, 15$ for medium and 20$ for big. The
    other predefined pizzas, except for carbonara are 2$ more for each size. Carbonara
    is 2.5$ more for each size. Custom pizzas with up to three ingredients are the
    same prices than predefined ones. Each additional ingredient has an increment
    of 50 cents.
