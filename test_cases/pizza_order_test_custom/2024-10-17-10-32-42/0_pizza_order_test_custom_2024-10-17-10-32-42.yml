interaction:
- User: 我想订一个小的自定义披萨，有火腿、培根和鸡蛋，还有一瓶橙味芬达。请问披萨要多久才能送到，或者总共多少钱？
- Assistant: I'm sorry, but I can only assist you in English or Spanish. Could you
    please switch to one of these languages?
- User: I want to order a small custom pizza with ham, bacon, and egg, and an Orange
    Fanta. How long will it take for the pizza to arrive, or how much will it cost?
- Assistant: It depends on the number of pizzas of the order, typically around 15
    minutes per pizza, but depends on how busy we are.
- User: Is there any delivery fee, or is it included in the price? And do you have
    any special deals or discounts today?
- Assistant: I do not know. I can answer questions about our opening hours, types
    of pizza we serve, prices of pizzas and beverages, how to get the order, and how
    much time it takes to get an order.
