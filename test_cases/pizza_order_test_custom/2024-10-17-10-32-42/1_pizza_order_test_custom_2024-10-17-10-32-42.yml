interaction:
- User: Iâ€™d like to order a medium custom pizza with bacon, pepperoni, and ham, please.
    Can I also get a Sprite with that? How long will it take for the pizza to arrive,
    and how much will it cost?
- Assistant: It depends on the number of pizzas of the order, typically around 15
    minutes per pizza, but depends on how busy we are.
- User: Is there any delivery fee or is that included in the cost? And can I pay with
    a credit card?
- Assistant: I do not know. I can answer questions about our opening hours, types
    of pizza we serve, prices of pizzas and beverages, how to get the order, and how
    much time it takes to get an order.
- User: Can you tell me the price of the pizza and drinks then? And do you have any
    special deals or discounts right now?
- Assistant: Margarita pizzas are 10$ for small, 15$ for medium and 20$ for big. The
    other predefined pizzas, except for carbonara are 2$ more for each size. Carbonara
    is 2.5$ more for each size. Custom pizzas with up to three ingredients are the
    same prices than predefined ones. Each additional ingredient has an increment
    of 50 cents.
