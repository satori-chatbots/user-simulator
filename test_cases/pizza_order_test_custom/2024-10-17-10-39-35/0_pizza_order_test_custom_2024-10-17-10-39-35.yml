- User: Hello there! I hope you're having a wonderful day. I would love to order a
    small, custom pizza, please. I'd like to have it topped with ham, mushrooms, and
    egg. Also, could I add a Sprite to that order? I'm curious, how long will it take
    for the pizza to arrive at my doorstep? Additionally, could you please inform
    me about the total cost of this delicious meal? Thank you so much!
- Assistant: It depends on the number of pizzas of the order, typically around 15
    minutes per pizza, but depends on how busy we are.
