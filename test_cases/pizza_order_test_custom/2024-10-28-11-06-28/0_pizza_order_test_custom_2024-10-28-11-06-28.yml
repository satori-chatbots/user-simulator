- Assistant: Hello
- User: Hi there, I would like to order a small custom pizza with cheese, onion, and
    bacon, and I'm also interested in getting a Coke to go with it, so could you please
    let me know how long it might take for the pizza to arrive at my location or how
    much the entire order will cost?
- Assistant: It depends on the number of pizzas of the order, typically around 15
    minutes per pizza, but depends on how busy we are.
- User: Thanks for providing that information about the typical preparation time,
    but could you also tell me if there are any special discounts or deals currently
    available for ordering a small custom pizza with cheese, onion, and bacon, along
    with a Coke, and is there an additional cost for delivery to my area, or is it
    included in the total price?
- Assistant: 'I''m sorry, I did not get what you said. Can you rephrase?`

    discounts or deals that apply to a small custom pizza with cheese, onion, and
    bacon, along with a Coke, and could you let me know if there''s an extra charge
    for delivery to my area, or is it included in the total price of my order?'

- User: 'I understand that there might be some communication issues, so let me try
    asking again in a slightly different way: Are there any promotional offers or
    discounts currently available that I could take advantage of when ordering a small
    custom pizza with cheese, onion, and bacon, and a Coke, and additionally, could
    you clarify if there is an extra delivery fee for bringing the order to my location,
    or if that charge is already included in the overall price you will provide?'
- Assistant: 'I''m sorry, I did not get what you said. Can you rephrase?`
