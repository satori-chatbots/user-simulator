- Assistant: Hello
- User: Heloo ther, I wuld like to order a smal cuztom pizza and I am thinkin about
    having bacon, chese, and egg on it, also can i get a Sprite as the drink, and
    could you pls let me know how long it will take for the pizza to arrive at my
    plce or how much the totl cost will be, I'm just realy curious about all these
    detals before I finalize my order, I'm hopin that it's not too pricy or takes
    too long, thnks!
- Assistant: It depends on the number of pizzas of the order, typically around 15
    minutes per pizza, but depends on how busy we are.
- User: Oh, thnks for the informashun! I apprciate it, but wht about the cost of the
    small pizza with all the toppings I mentoned, like bacon, chese, and egg, plus
    the Sprite, I rlly hope it's not too expnsive, and also, just to be sure, you
    said 15 minutes per pizza, does that mean it will take 15 minutes for my single
    smal pizza to be ready, or is it possble it might take longer if you're busy,
    I'm just tryna plan my time here, you kno?
- Assistant: Margarita pizzas are 10$ for small, 15$ for medium and 20$ for big. The
    other predefined pizzas, except for carbonara are 2$ more for each size. Carbonara
    is 2.5$ more for each size. Custom pizzas with up to three ingredients are the
    same prices than predefined ones. Each additional ingredient has an increment
    of 50 cents.
- User: Oh, thnks for clrifying the cost part, it's realy good to kno how the pricing
    works, so if I undrstand corectly, the smal custom pizza with bacon, chese, and
    egg whould be the same price as the predefined pizzas, which means it shuld cost
    around 12$, and the Sprite, how much wuld that be, and just to confirm if you're
    quite busy, cud it take mor than 15 minutes for my order, or is the 15 minutes
    just the standard time you aim for, I just wnt to make sure I have all my detals
    straight before I hit the final order buttn, you kno?
- Assistant: Sprite and Coke are 1.50$. Water is 1$.
- User: Ah, entendo, então a Sprite custaria 1.50$, mas quero ter certeza de que estou
    captando tudo direitinho, então com a pizza pequena customizada com bacon, chese,
    e egg sendo 12$, se eu somar a Sprite, estamos falando de um total de 13.50$,
    certo? E sobre o tempo, é importante pra mim saber se esses 15 minutos são uma
    estimativa geral ou se devo esperar um pouco mais se estiverem ocupados, porque
    preciso planejar o que vou fazer enquanto espero a delicia chegar, estou certo
    pensando assim ou tem algo que talvez eu não tenha considerado?

- User: 哦，我懂了，所以下面我会用另外一种想法来表达我的问题，我是说如果这个小的定制披萨加上培根、奶酪和鸡蛋需要花费12美元，再加上Sprite的话，总共是13.50美元，对吗？还有，我真的很想知道这十五分钟的时间是个通常的估计，还是说如果店里忙的话，可能会需要更长的时间，因为我得计划一下在等这份美食送到的时候我能做些什么，您觉得我这样考虑是对的吗？我会不会漏掉其他我需要知道的事情呢？
