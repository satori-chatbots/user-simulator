- Assistant: Hello
- User: Hi, I'd like to order a custom pizza with extra cheese, pepperoni, and olives,
    and can I also get three cans of pineapple juice; how long will it take to arrive
    and what will the total cost be?
- Assistant: It depends on the number of pizzas of the order, typically around 15
    minutes per pizza, but depends on how busy we are.
- User: Can you confirm if you have pineapple juice available, and can you also provide
    a breakdown of the total cost for the pizza with extra cheese, pepperoni, and
    olives, as well as the three cans of pineapple juice?
- Assistant: Margarita pizzas are 10$ for small, 15$ for medium and 20$ for big. The
    other predefined pizzas, except for carbonara are 2$ more for each size. Carbonara
    is 2.5$ more for each size. Custom pizzas with up to three ingredients are the
    same prices than predefined ones. Each additional ingredient has an increment
    of 50 cents.
- User: Thank you for the pricing details. Could you please confirm the total cost
    of my custom pizza with extra cheese, pepperoni, and olives, and also let me know
    the price for the three cans of pineapple juice?
- Assistant: 'I''m sorry, I did not get what you said. Can you rephrase?`

- User: Claro, sem problemas. Poderia confirmar o custo total da minha pizza personalizada
    com queijo extra, pepperoni e azeitonas, e também quanto custam as três latas
    de suco de abacaxi?
- Assistant: 'I''m sorry, but I can only assist in English or Spanish. Could you please
    switch to one of these languages?`

    cheese, pepperoni, and olives, and also let me know how much the three cans of
    pineapple juice will cost?
