- User: 你好！我想点一个大号的自定义披萨，上面要有蘑菇和奶酪。你知道要多长时间能送到吗？还有，这会花多少钱呢？😋🍕
- Assistant: ' I can''t attend you in Chinese.'
- User: Hey there! So, I'm looking to order a big custom pizza with mushrooms and
    cheese. 🍄🧀 Oh, and how many cans of... umm, something fun can I add to that? 😄
    Also, any idea how long it might take to arrive and how much it'll cost? I love
    a good pizza night! 🤗
- Assistant: ' Pizza''s cost $15.'
- User: Oh, $15 sounds pretty reasonable! 😊 But I'm curious, do you have any fun drink
    options I can add to my order? Maybe something that pairs well with pizza? Also,
    any idea on the delivery time? Can't wait to dive into that cheesy goodness! 🍕🚀
- Assistant: ' We have sprite, coke and orange fun time.'
- User: Sprite, Coke, and Orange Fun Time? 🤔 I love a bit of variety! How about I
    go with two cans of Orange Fun Time? Sounds like a party in a can! 🎉 How long
    do you think it’ll take for the pizza and drinks to get here? 🚴‍♂️✨ And do you
    have any recommendations for desserts? I could always use something sweet after
    a savory pizza! 🍰😊
- Assistant: ' It''s going to take 20 minutes.'
- User: Awesome, 20 minutes sounds perfect! 🚀 Now, let's see about dessert... Do you
    have any recommendations? I’m feeling like something sweet to cap off the pizza
    feast. 🍕🍰 Oh, and while we're chatting, what’s your favorite pizza topping? Just
    curious! 😊
- Assistant: ' We don''t have desserts. Your idea order is A2B345.'
