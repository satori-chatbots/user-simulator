- User: Greetings, most esteemed purveyor of fine Italian culinary delights, I must
    kindly inquire, whilst expressing my utmost appreciation for your anticipated
    prompt and precise response, whether it would be plausible to procure a generously
    proportioned pizza, meticulously customized to include an ample quantity of succulent
    mushrooms, alongside the enigmatic quantity of <function AskAboutClass.replace_variables.<locals>.replace_variable
    at 0x000001A03913A7A0> cans of <function AskAboutClass.replace_variables.<locals>.replace_variable
    at 0x000001A03913A7A0>, and, if I may further impose upon your esteemed self,
    what might the estimated duration for the delivery of said pizza be, as well as
    the total financial remuneration required to complete this most illustrious transaction?
- Assistant: It depends on the number of pizzas of the order, typically around 15
    minutes per pizza, but depends on how busy we are.
- User: 'Ah, I am profoundly grateful for your expeditious and informative response,
    yet I find myself compelled, in the spirit of meticulous inquiry, to pose an additional
    query regarding the culinary masterpiece I seek to acquire: could you kindly elucidate,
    with the utmost precision, the precise financial outlay required for such an epicurean
    indulgence, characterized by its lavish application of mushrooms and the aforementioned
    enigmatic quantity of canned beverages, whilst also considering any potential
    discounts or promotional offers that might be applicable to this esteemed transaction?'
- Assistant: Margarita pizzas are 10$ for small, 15$ for medium and 20$ for big. The
    other predefined pizzas, except for carbonara are 2$ more for each size. Carbonara
    is 2.5$ more for each size. Custom pizzas with up to three ingredients are the
    same prices than predefined ones. Each additional ingredient has an increment
    of 50 cents.
- User: Ah, most esteemed purveyor of culinary mastery, I must extend my sincerest
    gratitude for your detailed elucidation on the financial intricacies of this gastronomic
    endeavor; however, I am compelled to inquire further, albeit with a modicum of
    trepidation, as to whether there might exist a comprehensive enumeration of the
    delectable ingredients available for customization beyond the succulent mushrooms,
    and furthermore, should one be inclined to indulge in the acquisition of an extensive
    quantity of said mysterious canned elixirs, what might the financial implications
    be, particularly if such a request were to align fortuitously with any ongoing
    promotional incentives or discounts that your esteemed establishment might currently
    proffer?
- Assistant: We have Margarita, Carbonara, Marinera, Hawaiian, Four cheese, Vegetarian,
    and Custom (you choose the ingredients)
- User: Ah, esteemed custodian of culinary delights, your comprehensive response is
    received with infinite gratitude; yet, I remain fervently curious, driven by an
    insatiable thirst for precision, and thus I must inquire further concerning the
    specific ingredients available for personalizing a custom pizza, beyond the aforementioned
    mushroomsâ€”might you be so kind as to provide a detailed list of these savory options?
    Furthermore, I harbor an additional query pertaining to the fiscal ramifications
    of acquiring a substantial quantity of those enigmatic canned beverages, especially
    should there be serendipitous alignment with any current promotional incentives
    or discounts that your esteemed establishment might graciously extend to a discerning
    patron such as myself?
- Assistant: We have Margarita, Carbonara, Marinera, Hawaiian, Four cheese, Vegetarian,
    and Custom (you choose the ingredients)
- User: Ah, most esteemed curator of gastronomic wonders, I am profoundly appreciative
    of your gracious response, yet the inexorable pursuit of culinary enlightenment
    compels me to inquire, with a fervor that knows no bounds, as to whether you might
    be so kind as to furnish a comprehensive inventory of the exquisite ingredients
    available for the meticulous customization of a bespoke pizza, transcending the
    realm of mere mushrooms, for I yearn to explore the full spectrum of flavor possibilities;
    additionally, I am inclined to seek enlightenment regarding the fiscal implications
    of procuring a substantial cache of those mysterious canned libations, and I am
    particularly eager to ascertain whether any fortuitous confluence with promotional
    incentives or discounts might serve to ameliorate the pecuniary demands of this
    indulgence, thereby enhancing the overall satisfaction of this most illustrious
    culinary acquisition.
- Assistant: 'I''m sorry, I did not get what you said. Can you rephrase?`
