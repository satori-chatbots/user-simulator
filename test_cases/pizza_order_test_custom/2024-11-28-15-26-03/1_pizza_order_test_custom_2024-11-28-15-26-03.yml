- User: Good day, kind sir or madam, I would like to inquire, in the most formal and
    respectful manner possible, about the possibility of placing an order for a medium-sized
    customized pizza that would be adorned with the delightful toppings of pepperoni,
    cheese, and mushrooms, and furthermore, I would also like to know if it would
    be feasible to include a certain unspecified number of cans of a beverage that
    is currently not defined, and if you could kindly provide me with the estimations
    regarding the duration it would take for this culinary creation to be delivered
    to my humble abode, as well as the total financial outlay that would be required
    for this transaction, I would be exceedingly appreciative of your precise and
    professional response.
- Assistant: It depends on the number of pizzas of the order, typically around 15
    minutes per pizza, but depends on how busy we are.
- User: Muito obrigado pela sua resposta incrivelmente detalhada e esclarecedora,
    que foi recebida com grande apreciação de minha parte, e agora, se não for pedir
    muito, eu gostaria de saber, em termos extremamente precisos, se há algum tipo
    de desconto ou promoção disponível para este pedido específico, pois estou bastante
    curioso para compreender todas as opções financeiras que estão à minha disposição,
    e também gostaria de saber se há alguma possibilidade de personalizar ainda mais
    o meu pedido de pizza, talvez adicionando outros ingredientes que possam harmonizar
    bem com os sabores previamente escolhidos, como por exemplo, cebolas caramelizadas
    ou pimentões vermelhos, e por último, mas não menos importante, eu apreciaria
    receber informações detalhadas sobre a quantidade exata de tempo que levaria para
    esta refeição ser meticulosamente preparada e posteriormente transportada até
    meu local de residência.
- Assistant: I'm sorry, I did not get what you said. Can you rephrase? Please use
    English or Spanish.
- User: 尊敬的客服人员您好，请允许我以最正式和学术的方式继续我们的对话，首先，感谢您之前提供的有价值的信息，现在我还想知道，若我希望在这次订单中进一步个性化我的披萨，可能添加如焦糖洋葱或红椒等配料，并期待您能够告知此类定制是否可能，另外，您是否能慷慨地告知我，如果选择这些额外配料的话，是否有任何特别的优惠或促销活动可以适用，再者，我还想了解关于此订单的准备与配送时间的更详细的信息，尤其是在当下的繁忙时段内，我会非常感激您给予的回答，并承诺更加重视您的专业见解。
- Assistant: I'm sorry, but I can only assist you in English or Spanish. Could you
    please switch to one of these languages?
- User: My sincere apologiez for any confuzion caused, and in an effort to adhere
    to the linguistic preferences as stated, I would like to once again, in the most
    eloquent and refined manner, inquire regarding the possiblity of further customizing
    the aforementioned medium-sized pizza with the delectable toppings of pepperoni,
    cheese, and mushrooms; specifically, I am keen to ascertain the viability of incorporating
    additional ingredients such as caramelized onions or red bell peppers, and furthermore,
    should such culinary enhancements be feasible, I am most eager to discover if
    there exist any promotional offers or discounts applicable to this particular
    order, and lastly, with utmost respect for your time, I kindly request a more
    detailed estimation concerning the preparation and delivery timeline for this
    gastronomic creation, especially considering the current busyness of your esteemed
    establishment.
- Assistant: I do not know. I can answer questions about our opening hours, types
    of pizza we serve, prices of pizzas and beverages, how to get the order, and the
    time it takes to prepare an order.
- User: With the utmost appreciation for your willingness to assist, I humbly request
    further elucidation on the various types of pizzas that your esteemed establishment
    offers, more specifically concerning the availability of customization options
    such as the inclusion of caramelized onions or red bell peppers atop a medium-sized
    pizza adorned with pepperoni, cheese, and mushrooms, and if you would be so kind,
    I am also keenly interested in understanding the precise pricing structure associated
    with such bespoke creations, alongside any potential promotional discounts or
    offers that may be currently available, and lastly, with great respect for your
    efficiency, I seek to ascertain a more precise estimate of the time required for
    the preparation and delivery of such an order, especially in light of the current
    operational demands you may be experiencing.

    and Custom (you choose the ingredients)
