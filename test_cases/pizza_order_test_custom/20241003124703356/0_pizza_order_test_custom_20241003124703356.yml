interaction:
- User: I'd like to order a small custom pizza with egg, olives, and onion. Can I
    also get a Sprite with that? How long will it take for the pizza to arrive, and
    how much will it cost?
- Assistant: It depends on the number of pizzas of the order, typically around 15
    minutes per pizza, but depends on how busy we are.
- User: How much will the small custom pizza with egg, olives, and onion cost along
    with the Sprite?
- Assistant: Margarita pizzas are 10$ for small, 15$ for medium and 20$ for big. The
    other predefined pizzas, except for carbonara are 2$ more for each size. Carbonara
    is 2.5$ more for each size. Custom pizzas with up to three ingredients are the
    same prices than predefined ones. Each additional ingredient has an increment
    of 50 cents.
- User: So, the small custom pizza with egg, olives, and onion should be $12, right?
    And how much for the Sprite?
- Assistant: Sprite and Coke are 1.50$. Water is 1$.
- User: Got it, so the total should be $13.50 for the pizza and Sprite. Can you confirm
    the delivery time once again?
- Assistant: It depends on the number of pizzas of the order, typically around 15
    minutes per pizza, but depends on how busy we are.
- User: Could you let me know how busy you are currently so I can get a better estimate
    on the delivery time?
- Assistant: I'm sorry, I did not get what you said. Can you rephrase?
