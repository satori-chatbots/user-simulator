- User: Can I get a medium custom pizza with onion, mushrooms, olives, and a Coke,
    please? Also, could you let me know how long it will take to arrive and how much
    it will cost?
- Assistant: It depends on the number of pizzas of the order, typically around 15
    minutes per pizza, but depends on how busy we are.
- User: How much will the pizza and Coke cost, and do you have any special deals or
    discounts available right now?
- Assistant: Margarita pizzas are 10$ for small, 15$ for medium and 20$ for big. The
    other predefined pizzas, except for carbonara are 2$ more for each size. Carbonara
    is 2.5$ more for each size. Custom pizzas with up to three ingredients are the
    same prices than predefined ones. Each additional ingredient has an increment
    of 50 cents.
