    also want a Orang Fanta to drink? Also, can you tel me how long it will take to
    arive or how much it will cost?
- Assistant: It depends on the number of pizzas of the order, typically around 15
    minutes per pizza, but depends on how busy we are.
- User: How muchh will a smmal custom pizza with thosee toppings and the Orang Fanta
    cost, and if I add more stuf, will that make it take longer?
- Assistant: Margarita pizzas are 10$ for small, 15$ for medium and 20$ for big. The
    other predefined pizzas, except for carbonara are 2$ more for each size. Carbonara
    is 2.5$ more for each size. Custom pizzas with up to three ingredients are the
    same prices than predefined ones. Each additional ingredient has an increment
    of 50 cents.

    and wil it tak even longer to delivr my smal pizza with the Orang Fanta?
- Assistant: I do not know. I can answer questions about our opening hours, types
    of pizza we serve, prices of pizzas and beverages, how to get the order, and how
    much time it takes to get an order.
- User: Okay, so if I want to ad extra cheeze or peproni, will it be around 50 cents
    more per toppng, and howw much time will it ad to the delivery for my small costom
    pizza with onion, mushroms, and cheeze, plus the Orang Fanta?
- Assistant: I do not know. I can answer questions about our opening hours, types
    of pizza we serve, prices of pizzas and beverages, how to get the order, and how
    much time it takes to get an order.
- User: So, if I just stik with the onion, mushroms, and cheeze toppings for the small
    pizza, and get the Orang Fanta, wil the delivery tim stil be about 15 minutes,
    and the cost would be around 12$? Or should I expect it to be different?
- Assistant: It depends on the number of pizzas of the order, typically around 15
    minutes per pizza, but depends on how busy we are.
