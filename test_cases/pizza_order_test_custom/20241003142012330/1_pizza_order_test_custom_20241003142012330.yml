- Assistant: It depends on the number of pizzas of the order, typically around 15
    minutes per pizza, but depends on how busy we are.

    for delivery or iz that includid in the price of the pizaa and drink alredy, plus
    do u guys hav any options to add extra cheese or extra topings for free or is
    ther a feee for that, and in case I want to change the drink from coke to something
    like sprite or any othr soft drink, is that posibble without any extra cost, and
    also do u offer any kin of loyalty program or any sort of points system for regular
    custmers that I shuld know about so I can save a bit more money on future orders,
    and wot are the acceptable payment methods for my order, do u take cards or is
    it cash only?
- Assistant: I do not know. I can answer questions about our opening hours, types
    of pizza we serve, prices of pizzas and beverages, how to get the order, and how
    much time it takes to get an order.
- User: Oh okay, thanx for lettin me kno, so cud u pls tell me wot the current prices
    are for a medim custom pizaa with egg, peproni, and oniun, and how much does a
    cok cost, cuz I wnt to make sure I'm calculatin my budget corectly before I place
    the order, and also since u menchuned u cud help with time, can u confirm if the
    wait time is still arund 15 mins or if its gon be longer today, and also if ther
    are any special types of pizaa u wud recomend for my next order that might be
    a bit difrent or unique compared to the custm one I'm gettin now, and if I want
    to order another time, do u guys have any webste or app I can use to place my
    orders more easily?
- Assistant: Margarita pizzas are 10$ for small, 15$ for medium and 20$ for big. The
    other predefined pizzas, except for carbonara are 2$ more for each size. Carbonara
    is 2.5$ more for each size. Custom pizzas with up to three ingredients are the
    same prices than predefined ones. Each additional ingredient has an increment
    of 50 cents.
- User: Thanks for the price info, so just to be clear if I get a medim custom pizaa
    with egggg, peproni, and oniun that's gonna be the same as the medium predefined
    ones, right, and if I wanna add any extra toppings like maybe mushrooms or green
    peppers, it would just be an extra 50 cents for each of those, correct me if I'm
    wrong? Also, cud u let me kno how much a coke cost, and in case you have any other
    drinks at a similar price, that wuld be great to know too. Plus, about the wait
    time, is it really gonna be around 15 mins for tday or should I expect a longer
    wait? And one last thing, if I decide to order another time, do u have a webste
    or app where I can make the order more easily, or do I just call the store directly?
