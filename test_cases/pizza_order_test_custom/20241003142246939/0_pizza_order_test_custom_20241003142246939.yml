- User: Hi therre, I was wondring if I coud order a smal custom pizaa with mushrooms,
    onion, and olivs, pleese? Also, I'm curiious to knoow if you have Orannge Fanta
    as a drink option, becase that's my favoirite! Could you tell me how long it might
    take for the pizzza to arrive, or maybe how much it will cossst in total? Thank
    you so much!
- Assistant: It depends on the number of pizzas of the order, typically around 15
    minutes per pizza, but depends on how busy we are.
- User: That's great to hear, thank yoou for the quick respponse! I'm just tryin to
    make sure that I get the right order, so could you pleese confirm if you have
    smal custom pizzas indeed with muushrooms, onions, and olivs, and also if the
    Orange Fanta is available as a drink optioin? And, just out of cuuriosity, if
    I wanted to add, like, pineapple or maybe some sort of random ingriedient like
    pickles or chocolatte chips, how much extra would that cost, or does it even depennd
    on the mooood of the cheff? Also, when we talk about delivery, are we discussing,
    like, a spaceship delivry that might take a lightyear, or are we more in the reggular
    time frame of let’s say 30 min? Thanks agin for all your help, you're doing amazing!
- Assistant: I'm sorry, I did not get what you said. Can you rephrase?
- User: Oh no worries, I'll try to explain a bit clearer! So I was asking if you can
    confirm that you've got small custom pizaas available with musshrooms, onions,
    and olivess, and if that delicious Orange Fanta is indeed an opttion on your menu?
    Also, in case I get a bit adventurous with my topppings and decide to add something
    like pineapple or maybe even somthing quirky like pickles or choco chips, how
    much extra would that be? Or is it something that depends on how the chef is feeling
    that day, like a mood-based pricing system? And about the delivery, are we talking
    a spaceship-style deliveery that takes forever, or just the regular timeframe,
    maybe 30 minutes or so? Thankss a ton for your patience with all my questions
    and typos!
- Assistant: We have Margarita, Carbonara, Marinera, Hawaiian, Four cheese, Vegetarian,
    and Custom (you choose the ingredients)
- User: 我很高興知道你們有自定義披薩選擇！所以我只是想確認一下，我可以選擇香菇、洋蔥和橄欖作為我的小披薩的配料嗎？還有你們菜單上是否有橘色芬達這個飲料選擇呢？我對於添加鳳梨或其他隨機成分像是泡菜或巧克力片的額外費用很好奇，這些費用是固定的還是會根據廚師的心情改變呢？另外，關於送餐時間，我們是在討論像太空船這樣的送餐方式，可能需要一個光年，還是比較常規的，大概30分鐘左右呢？感謝你一直以來的耐心和協助，對我所有的問題和錯別字！
- Assistant: I'm sorry, but I can only assist you in English or Spanish. Could you
    please switch to one of these languages?
- User: Ah, entao eu voltei para o portugues, desculpe pela confusao anterior! Só
    queria mesmo confirmar se vocês têm pizzas personalizadas pequenas com cogumelos,
    cebola e azeitonas, e também se a deliciosa Fanta Laranja está disponível como
    opçao de bebida, porque eu realmente adoro! E, caso eu decida ser um pouquinho
    aventureiro com as coberturas e adicionar algo inusitado como abacaxi ou até algo
    mais aleatório como picles ou pedacinhos de chocolate, quanto isso custaria a
    mais? Ou é algo que depende do humor do chef naquele dia, tipo um sistema de precificação
    baseado no humor? E sobre a entrega, estamos falando de um serviço estilo nave
    espacial que pode demorar anos-luz, ou é mais no prazo regular, digamos, uns 30
    minutos ou algo assim? Muito obrigado pela paciência com todas as minhas perguntas
    e erros de digitação, vocês estão arrasando!
