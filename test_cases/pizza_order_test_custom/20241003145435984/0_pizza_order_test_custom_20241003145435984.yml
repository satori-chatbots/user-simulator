- User: I would like to order a small custom pizza with egg, onion, and bacon, and
    an Orange Fanta; can you tell me how long it will take to arrive and what the
    total cost is?
- Assistant: It depends on the number of pizzas of the order, typically around 15
    minutes per pizza, but depends on how busy we are.
- User: That sounds good! Could you please confirm the total cost for my order of
    a small custom pizza with egg, onion, and bacon, along with an Orange Fanta?
- Assistant: Margarita pizzas are 10$ for small, 15$ for medium and 20$ for big. The
    other predefined pizzas, except for carbonara are 2$ more for each size. Carbonara
    is 2.5$ more for each size. Custom pizzas with up to three ingredients are the
    same prices than predefined ones. Each additional ingredient has an increment
    of 50 cents.

    cipolla e bacon, e una Fanta Orange, quale sarebbe il costo totale?

    switch to one of these languages?
