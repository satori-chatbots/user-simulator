- User: Hey there! 😊 I was thinking of ordering a small carbonara pizza. Do you guys
    have a vegan version of that? Also, what do you think about the weather today?
    It's been kind of unpredictable lately! 🌦️
- Assistant: I'm sorry, I did not get what you said. Can you rephrase?
- User: Hey! No worries, I was just wondering if you have a small carbonara pizza,
    but with a vegan twist? I'm trying to stick to my plant-based diet. 😄 Also, how's
    your day going so far?
- Assistant: Hi there! I hope you're having a great day. At Fast Pizza, we offer a
    variety of toppings to customize your pizza. Could you please let me know which
    toppings you'd like on your small pizza? Our available toppings are cheese, mushrooms,
    pepper, ham, bacon, pepperoni, olives, corn, and chicken. Let me know your preferences!
- User: Hey, thanks for getting back to me! 😊 For the vegan twist, could we go with
    mushrooms, olives, and maybe some peppers? That sounds pretty good to me! Also,
    do you guys have those Old Fashioned cans? I was thinking of grabbing one along
    with the pizza. 🍕🥤 By the way, do you like watching any shows or movies? I'm always
    looking for new recommendations!
- Assistant: 'Thanks for ordering a small pizza with mushrooms, olives and pepper!

    It looks like I still need a bit more information to complete your order. Could
    you please let me know how many drinks you''d like and which type you prefer?
    We have coke, sprite, and water available. Thank you! 😊'
