- User: Hey there! 😊 I was thinking about getting a pizza tonight. Could you help
    me out with a small margarita pizza? Also, I'm curious, how long do you think
    it'll take for the pizza to get here? I've got a craving that's hard to ignore!
    🍕 And oh, by the way, I'm vegan—any fun stories from other vegan customers?
- Assistant: It depends on the number of pizzas of the order, typically around 15
    minutes per pizza, but depends on how busy we are.
- User: Gotcha! Thanks for the estimate. I think I can wait 15 minutes, but I'll definitely
    be counting down! 😄 By the way, could you add 3 cans of Fanta to the order? I'm
    in the mood for something fizzy tonight. 🥤 Do you have a favorite drink you like
    to pair with pizza?
- Assistant: I'm sorry, I did not get what you said. Can you rephrase?
- User: 'Sure thing! Could you please add 3 cans of Fanta to my order? I''m really
    in the mood for something fizzy tonight. 🥤 What''s your favorite drink to pair
    with pizza, if you''ve got one? '
- Assistant: I'm sorry, I did not get what you said. Can you rephrase?
