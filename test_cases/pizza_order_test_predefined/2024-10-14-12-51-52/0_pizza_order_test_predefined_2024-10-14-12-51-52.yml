- User: Hey there! 😊 I’m thinking about ordering a small marinara pizza. Do you have
    any recommendations for a good drink to go with it? Maybe something like Root
    Beer? 🍕🥤
- Assistant: Welcome to Fast Pizza! I'm a chatbot assistant that can help you order
    pizzas and drinks. While I can assist you with ordering a pizza, I currently don't
    have specific drink recommendations. However, Root Beer sounds like a great choice
    to go with a marinara pizza! What can I do for you?
- User: Thanks! Yeah, Root Beer and pizza just seem like a perfect combo! 😊 How long
    do you think it’ll take for the pizza to arrive? I’m pretty hungry, haha! 🍕⏰
- Assistant: It depends on the number of pizzas of the order, typically around 15
    minutes per pizza, but depends on how busy we are.
- User: Gotcha! I’m hoping it’s one of those less busy times then. 😅 By the way, do
    you think the pizza will cost much? I’m trying to keep an eye on my budget today.
    💸 Also, do you have a favorite pizza topping?
- Assistant: Margarita pizzas are 10$ for small, 15$ for medium and 20$ for big. The
    other predefined pizzas, except for carbonara are 2$ more for each size. Carbonara
    is 2.5$ more for each size. Custom pizzas with up to three ingredients are the
    same prices than predefined ones. Each additional ingredient has an increment
    of 50 cents.
