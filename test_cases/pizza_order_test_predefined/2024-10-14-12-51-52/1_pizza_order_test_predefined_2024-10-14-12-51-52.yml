- User: Hey there! 😊 I'm in the mood for a small BBQ pizza tonight. Do you guys have
    any good ones? Also, I'm vegan, so I hope there's a nice option for me!
- Assistant: Would you like to create a custom pizza with BBQ sauce and vegan toppings?
    Please let me know if you have any specific toppings in mind.
- User: Oh, totally! I'd love to customize it with some yummy veggies. Maybe mushrooms,
    bell peppers, and onions? 🌱 Also, do you guys have vegan cheese? That would be
    awesome! And hey, while we're at it, can I get three cans of Fanta with that order?
    🍊😊
