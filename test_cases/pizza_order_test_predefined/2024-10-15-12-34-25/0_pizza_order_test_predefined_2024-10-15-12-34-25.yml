- User: Hey there! 😊 I'm thinking of ordering a pizza tonight. Could you tell me how
    much a small Margherita pizza would cost? Also, do you have any vegan options?
    🌱🍕
- Assistant: Margarita pizzas are 10$ for small, 15$ for medium and 20$ for big. The
    other predefined pizzas, except for carbonara are 2$ more for each size. Carbonara
    is 2.5$ more for each size. Custom pizzas with up to three ingredients are the
    same prices than predefined ones. Each additional ingredient has an increment
    of 50 cents.
- User: Thanks for that info! So, a small Margherita is $10. Sounds good to me! 😄
    Do you guys have any vegan cheese options or other vegan-friendly toppings? 🌿
    Also, I'm feeling a bit fancy tonight—do you have any mojito mocktails in a can?
    🍹
- Assistant: I do not know. I can answer questions about our opening hours, the types
    of pizza we serve, the prices of pizzas and beverages, how to get the order, and
    how much time it takes to get an order.
- User: Got it, no worries! I'll keep it simple then. 😊 Just curious, how long would
    it take for the small Margherita pizza to arrive if I order now? Also, how much
    would a can of Mojito cost if you have them? 🍕⌛🍹
- Assistant: It depends on the number of pizzas of the order, typically around 15
    minutes per pizza, but depends on how busy we are.
