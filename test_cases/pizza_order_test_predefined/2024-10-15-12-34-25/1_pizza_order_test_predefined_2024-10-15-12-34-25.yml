- User: Hey there! 😊 I'm looking to order a small four cheese pizza. Could you tell
    me a bit about the toppings or how delicious it is? Also, I'm super curious if
    it’s as cheesy as my friends say! 🍕 Also, do you know if you guys have Dr Pepper?
    I'm thinking about getting 3 cans.
- Assistant: It looks like you've already provided the pizza size as "small" and the
    pizza type as "four cheese." Is there anything else you would like to add or change
    to your order?
- User: Oh, I’m definitely sticking with the small four cheese pizza! But I'm curious,
    do you think I should add extra toppings, or is the cheese-liciousness just perfect
    as it is? And about those three cans of Dr Pepper, I hope they're as refreshing
    as I remember! 😄 By the way, how long do you think it'll take for the pizza to
    arrive? I'm already getting hungry just thinking about it! 🍕🥤
- Assistant: 'Thanks for ordering a small four cheese pizza!

    It looks like you mentioned three cans of Dr Pepper, but unfortunately, we only
    offer coke, sprite, or water. Could you please let me know which of these drinks
    you''d like and how many? Thank you!'
- User: Oh, bummer about the Dr Pepper! 🤔 I guess I'll go with three cans of Coke
    then. Gotta have something fizzy with my pizza, right? 😄 Do you think I should
    add some veggies on top of the pizza, or is it cheesy goodness enough on its own?
    And hey, how long do you think it'll take for my order to get here? I'm so ready
    to dig in! 🍕🥤
- Assistant: 'Sure, I''ve received your order for three Cokes.
