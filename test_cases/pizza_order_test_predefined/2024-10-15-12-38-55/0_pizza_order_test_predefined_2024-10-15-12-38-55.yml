- User: Hey there! 😊 I'm in the mood for something tasty and was wondering if you
    have a small carbonara pizza I could order? Also, do you know if it'll take long
    for it to arrive? I'm kinda starving! 🍕
- Assistant: It looks like you want a small carbonara pizza. Is that correct? If so,
    I have all the information I need to place your order.
- User: Yes, that's right! A small carbonara pizza sounds perfect. Oh, and while we're
    at it, can I also grab a can of Margarita? 🍹 I know it's a cocktail, but a can
    sounds pretty interesting, right? How much is this going to cost me? 😊
- Assistant: 'Thanks for ordering a small carbonara pizza!

    It seems like you want to add a drink to your order. Could you please let me know
    how many drinks you would like and which drink you prefer? We have coke, sprite,
    and water available. Unfortunately, we don''t have Margarita in a can. 😊'
- User: Aw, that's a bummer about the Margarita in a can! 😅 Oh well, maybe next time.
    Could you just pop a can of coke in with the order then? That'll do the trick!
    Also, just curious—how long is it going to take for my pizza to arrive? I'm so
    ready to dig in! 🍕🚚
