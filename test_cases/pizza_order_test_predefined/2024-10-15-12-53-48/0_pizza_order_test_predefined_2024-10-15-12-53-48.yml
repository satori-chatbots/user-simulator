interaction:
- User: Hey there! üòä I'm thinking about ordering a small BBQ pizza. Do you guys have
    vegan options for that? Also, I could really go for a can of Dr. Pepper. üçïü•§ How
    long do you think it might take for the pizza to arrive?
- Assistant: I do not know. I can answer questions about our opening hours, the types
    of pizza we serve, the prices of pizzas and beverages, how to get the order, and
    how much time it takes to get an order.
