interaction:
- User: Hey there! ðŸ˜Š I'm thinking of ordering a small four cheese pizza. Do you guys
    offer vegan cheese options by any chance? ðŸŒ± Oh, and I'm really craving a can of
    Mountain Dew to go with it. How does that sound?
- Assistant: I do not know. I can answer questions about our opening hours, types
    of pizza we serve, prices of pizzas and beverages, how to get the order, and how
    much time it takes to get an order.
