- User: Hey there! 😊 I'm thinking of ordering a small four cheese pizza. Do you guys
    have that? Also, what kind of drinks do you have? I'm in the mood for something
    fun like a Mai Tai. 🍹
- Assistant: It looks like you've already chosen a small four cheese pizza. Is there
    anything else I can assist you with?
- User: Hey again! 😊 Yep, a small four cheese pizza sounds perfect. I was also wondering
    if I could get 5 cans of Mai Tai with that? How long do you think it'll take for
    the pizza to arrive? And how much will it all cost? Just trying to plan my chill
    night in! 🍕🍹 Oh, by the way, are you a fan of pizza too?
- Assistant: 'Thanks for ordering a small four cheese pizza!

    It seems like you want to order some drinks with your pizza. However, we only
    offer coke, sprite, and water. Could you please let me know which drink you''d
    like and how many? 😊'
- User: Oh, bummer! 😅 I was really looking forward to those Mai Tais. I guess I’ll
    go with 5 cans of Sprite then. How long do you think it'll take for the pizza
    to arrive? Just trying to plan my cozy night in. Also, out of curiosity, what's
    your favorite pizza topping? 🍕
- Assistant: 'Alright, I have received your order for 5 Sprite.
