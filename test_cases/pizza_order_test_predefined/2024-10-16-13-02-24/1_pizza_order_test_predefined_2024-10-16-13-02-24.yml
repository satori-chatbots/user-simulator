- User: Hey there! 😊 I was just wondering if I could order a small pepperoni pizza
    from you guys. Oh, and do you have Sprite? I could really go for a few cans! 🍕🥤
- Assistant: 'Thanks for ordering a small pizza with pepperoni!

    Could you please let me know how many drinks you would like to order and confirm
    if you would like Sprite or another drink option (coke, sprite, water)?'
- User: Hey again! 😄 Yep, Sprite it is! Could I get three cans of that fizzy goodness,
    please? 🥤 By the way, how long do you think the pizza will take to arrive? I’m
    getting pretty hungry just thinking about it! 🍕⏰
- Assistant: 'Sure, I''ve received your order for three Sprites.

    The cost for a small pepperoni pizza and three Sprites is $14.50.

    Your order will be ready in 15 minutes. Please visit our shop at 23 Main Street,
    NY. Your order ID is d7907b.

- User: Oh, 23 Main Street, huh? That's not too far! 🚶‍♂️ I might just take a little
    walk to pick it up. By the way, do you guys have any vegan options? I'm trying
    to balance out my pizza cravings with some plant-based goodness. 🌱 Also, do you
    have any fun toppings people usually go for on their pizzas? I'm curious!
- Assistant: We have Margarita, Carbonara, Marinera, Hawaiian, Four cheese, Vegetarian,
    and Custom (you choose the ingredients)
- User: Nice, a little stroll sounds perfect! 🚶‍♂️ Ah, a Vegetarian option could be
    my go-to then! Do you have any cool veggies or toppings that people seem to love
    adding on their pizzas? Maybe something I haven’t tried before? 🍄🌶️ Also, just
    wondering, do you have any plant-based cheese options? That would make it even
    better! 🧀✨
- Assistant: I'm sorry, I did not get what you said. Can you rephrase?
- User: Oops, looks like my question got a bit jumbled there! 😅 I was just curious
    if you have any unique veggies or toppings that people love on their pizzas. Plus,
    do you offer any plant-based cheese options? That would be awesome! 🍆🧄🌿
