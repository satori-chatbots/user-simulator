- User: Hey there! 😊 I'm in the mood for a little pizza treat. Could you help me out
    with ordering a small four cheese pizza? Oh, and I’d love a can of Sprite to go
    along with it. How long do you think it’ll take for the pizza to get here? 🍕🥤
- Assistant: It depends on the number of pizzas of the order, typically around 15
    minutes per pizza, but depends on how busy we are.
- User: That sounds pretty quick! I guess it won’t be long before I’m enjoying that
    cheesy goodness. 😋 By the way, how much is the total cost for the small four cheese
    pizza and the Sprite? Just curious to know what the damage is gonna be on my wallet.
    Also, do you have any vegan options? I've been exploring vegan choices lately!

- Assistant: Margarita pizzas are 10$ for small, 15$ for medium and 20$ for big. The
    other predefined pizzas, except for carbonara are 2$ more for each size. Carbonara
    is 2.5$ more for each size. Custom pizzas with up to three ingredients are the
    same prices than predefined ones. Each additional ingredient has an increment
    of 50 cents.
- User: Okay, so if I’m getting this right, a small four cheese pizza would be around
    $12, and I guess the Sprite will add a bit more to that. I’m trying to do the
    mental math here, but it’s kinda making me hungry! 😄 Speaking of which, do you
    have any vegan pizzas? Maybe something with lots of veggies or a yummy vegan cheese?
