- User: Hey there! 👋 I'm thinking about ordering some pizza tonight. You guys have
    a small marinara pizza, right? 🍕 Also, I heard you have Dr. Pepper? I might need
    a couple of cans, or maybe three... 😋 How's your day going?
- Assistant: We have Margarita, Carbonara, Marinera, Hawaiian, Four cheese, Vegetarian,
    and Custom (you choose the ingredients)
- User: Oh, awesome! A small marinara pizza sounds perfect for tonight. 🌟 And I definitely
    want to grab three cans of Dr. Pepper. 😄 How long do you think it’ll take for
    the pizza to arrive? Also, just out of curiosity, do you think pizza delivery
    folks get to snag a slice every now and then, or is that totally off-limits? 🤔
- Assistant: It depends on the number of pizzas of the order, typically around 15
    minutes per pizza, but depends on how busy we are.
- User: Ah, gotcha! So, if I’m just ordering one small pizza, it might be here in
    15 minutes-ish? That’s pretty quick! 🚀 I hope they don’t have to wait too long
    before they can grab a slice themselves, haha. 😄 By the way, how much is it going
    to cost for the pizza and the Dr. Pepper? Just trying to make sure I have enough
    for a tip! 💸 Also, do you have a favorite pizza? I always think it’s fun to know
    what people in the pizza biz love to eat! 🍕
- Assistant: Margarita pizzas are 10$ for small, 15$ for medium and 20$ for big. The
    other predefined pizzas, except for carbonara are 2$ more for each size. Carbonara
    is 2.5$ more for each size. Custom pizzas with up to three ingredients are the
    same prices than predefined ones. Each additional ingredient has an increment
    of 50 cents.
