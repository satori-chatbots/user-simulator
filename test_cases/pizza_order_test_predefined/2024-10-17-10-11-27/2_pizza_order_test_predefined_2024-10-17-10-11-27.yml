- User: Hey there! 😊 I'm thinking about ordering a pizza and I was wondering, do you
    guys have a small margarita pizza on the menu? Also, I'm in the mood for something
    fizzy—do you have Fanta? Maybe, like, five cans? 😄
- Assistant: I see that you are interested in a small margarita pizza. Would you like
    to proceed with ordering it, or is there anything else you'd like to add or change?
- User: Oh yes, that small margarita pizza sounds perfect! 🍕 How long do you think
    it would take for the pizza to arrive? I'm getting hungry just thinking about
    it! 😋 And hey, how much will it cost altogether with the Fanta, by the way?
- Assistant: 'Thanks for ordering a small margarita pizza!

    It looks like I need some additional information to complete your order. Could
    you please let me know how many drinks you''d like and which type of drink you
    prefer? We have coke, sprite, and water available. Unfortunately, we don''t have
    Fanta. Thank you!'
- User: Oh no, no Fanta? 😅 That's a bummer, but no worries! Let's go with five cans
    of Sprite instead. I'm really curious about how much all of this will cost now.
    And back to that delivery time—any idea when I can expect my delicious pizza to
    arrive? 🍕⏰
- Assistant: 'Thanks for ordering a small margarita pizza!

    Thank you for providing the information! You have ordered five cans of Sprite.
    I''ll pass this information along with your pizza order. As for the delivery time,
    it typically takes about 30-45 minutes for the pizza to arrive. If you have any
    other questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask!'
