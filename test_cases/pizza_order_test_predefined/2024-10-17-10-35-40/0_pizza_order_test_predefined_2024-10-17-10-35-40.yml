- User: Hey there! 🌟 I'm craving some pizza tonight, but I'm on a vegan diet. Do you
    have a small four cheese pizza that's vegan-friendly? Also, I'd love to wash it
    down with a nice cold Margarita. 😄 How long would it take for the pizza to arrive
    if I order now?
- Assistant: I do not know. I can answer questions about our opening hours, types
    of pizza we serve, prices of pizzas and beverages, how to get the order, and how
    much time it takes to prepare an order.
- User: Oh, okay! No worries. 😊 So, about that small four cheese pizza—any chance
    you have a vegan version of it? And I'm really curious, how much does a can of
    Margarita cost? 🍹 Also, how long would it generally take from order to delivery?
    Just trying to plan my epic pizza night, you know? 😋
- Assistant: I do not know. I can answer questions about our opening hours, types
    of pizza we serve, prices of pizzas and beverages, how to get the order, and how
    much time it takes to get an order.
- User: Got it! Thanks for letting me know. So, what types of pizzas do you have on
    the menu? I'm really hoping there's a vegan option somewhere. 🌱 Also, could you
    tell me the price of a small four cheese pizza, just in case I decide to have
    a cheat day? 😅 And about the Margarita—how do I get it alongside my order? 🍸
- Assistant: We have Margarita, Carbonara, Marinera, Hawaiian, Four cheese, Vegetarian,
    and Custom (you choose the ingredients)
