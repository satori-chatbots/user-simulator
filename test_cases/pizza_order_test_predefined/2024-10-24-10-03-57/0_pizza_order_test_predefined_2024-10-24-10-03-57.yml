- User: Hey there! üòä I'm thinking about ordering a pizza tonight. Could you tell me
    about your small four cheese pizza? I'm a vegan, so I'm curious if you have any
    vegan cheese options. Also, do you have Fanta? üçä
- Assistant: We have Margarita, Carbonara, Marinera, Hawaiian, Four cheese, Vegetarian,
    and Custom (you choose the ingredients)
- User: Oh, nice! The Four Cheese sounds tempting, but since I'm vegan, I'm really
    hoping you have some vegan cheese options. Do you offer that? Also, I'm really
    craving a Fanta. Do you have it in stock? üçïü•§
- Assistant: I do not know. I can answer questions about our opening hours, the types
    of pizza we serve, the prices of pizzas and beverages, how to get the order, and
    how much time it takes to get an order.
- User: Got it! So, how much would a small four cheese pizza cost if you have vegan
    cheese? And how much is a can of Fanta? Also, how long would it take for the pizza
    to arrive? I'm getting hungry just thinking about it! üòã
- Assistant: Margarita pizzas are 10$ for small, 15$ for medium and 20$ for big. The
    other predefined pizzas, except for carbonara are 2$ more for each size. Carbonara
    is 2.5$ more for each size. Custom pizzas with up to three ingredients are the
    same prices than predefined ones. Each additional ingredient has an increment
    of 50 cents.
- User: Thanks for the info! So, if I go for the small Four Cheese with vegan cheese,
    it would be $12, right? And what about the Fanta? How much is a can? Also, any
    idea how long it might take for the delivery? I'm getting super excited for this
    pizza night! üçïüòÑ
- Assistant: Sprite and Coke are 1.50$. Water is 1$.
- User: No worries, I'll just assume the Fanta might be around the same price as the
    Sprite and Coke, maybe $1.50? ü§î And I'm still curious about the delivery time.
    How long do you think it'll take for the pizza to arrive? I'm really looking forward
    to it! üçï‚è∞
- Assistant: It depends on the number of pizzas of the order, typically around 15
    minutes per pizza, but depends on how busy we are.
