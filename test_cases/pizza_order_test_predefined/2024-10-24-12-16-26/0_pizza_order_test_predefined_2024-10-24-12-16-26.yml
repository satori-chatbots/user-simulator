- User: Hey there! üòä I'm in the mood for some pizza tonight. Could you tell me if
    you have a small carbonara pizza? Also, I'm vegan, so I'm curious if you have
    any vegan options or if the carbonara can be made vegan. üçï‚ú®
- Assistant: We do have a predefined Carbonara pizza, but it is not vegan. However,
    we offer a Vegetarian pizza as a vegan option. Would you like to order the Vegetarian
    pizza or customize a pizza to make it vegan? Please let me know your preference.
- User: Oh, that's good to know! I might go for the Vegetarian pizza then. üåø But before
    I decide, could you tell me if you have any vegan cheese options? Also, I'm thinking
    of getting a can of Coca-Cola with it. Do you have that available? ü•§
- Assistant: Yes, we do offer vegan cheese as an option for our pizzas, including
    the Vegetarian pizza. And we do have cans of Coca-Cola available. Would you like
    to proceed with ordering the Vegetarian pizza with vegan cheese and a can of Coca-Cola?
- User: That sounds perfect! üòÑ I'll go with the Vegetarian pizza with vegan cheese
    and a can of Coca-Cola. How long do you think it'll take for the pizza to arrive?
    Also, just curious, do you have any favorite pizza toppings? üçï
- Assistant: 'I''m sorry, I did not get what you said. Can you rephrase?`
