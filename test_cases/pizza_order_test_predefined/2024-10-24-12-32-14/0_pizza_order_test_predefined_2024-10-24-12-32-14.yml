- User: Hey there! 😊 I'm thinking about ordering a pizza tonight. Do you guys have
    a small BBQ pizza? Also, I'm curious, do you have any vegan options? 🌱
- Assistant: I'm sorry, we don't have a predefined BBQ pizza. However, you can create
    a custom pizza with BBQ sauce and your choice of toppings. We also have a vegetarian
    pizza as a predefined option, which can be made vegan by removing cheese. Would
    you like to order a custom pizza or choose from our predefined options?
- User: Oh, I see! Custom pizza sounds fun. 😄 Can I get a small one with BBQ sauce,
    maybe some veggies like bell peppers and onions? And could you make it vegan,
    please? Also, do you have Dr Pepper? I could really use a can of that right now!
    🥤
- Assistant: 'It looks like we need to adjust your order a bit. For the pizza, we
    offer the following toppings: cheese, mushrooms, pepper, ham, bacon, pepperoni,
    olives, corn, and chicken. Could you please choose from these options? Also, we
    don''t have Dr Pepper, but we do offer a variety of other drinks. Let me know
    if you''d like to hear about them!'
- User: Oh, bummer about the Dr Pepper! 😅 No worries, though. What other drinks do
    you have? Maybe there's something else that will hit the spot. As for the pizza,
    let's go with mushrooms, peppers, and olives. And of course, make it vegan with
    that BBQ sauce! 🍕 How long do you think it'll take for the pizza to arrive? I'm
    getting pretty hungry over here! 😋
- Assistant: 'Thanks for ordering a small pizza with mushrooms, pepper and olives!

    We offer coke, sprite, and water as drink options. Could you please let me know
    how many drinks you would like and which ones you prefer? Once I have that information,
    I can give you an estimated delivery time for your order. Thank you!'
- User: Hmm, I think I'll go with a can of Coke then. 🥤 Just one should do the trick!
    So, with the pizza and the Coke, how long do you think it'll take for everything
    to get here? I'm really looking forward to it! 😄 Also, do you have any idea how
    much this will cost? Just trying to plan my evening a bit. 😊
- Assistant: 'Sure, I''ve received your order for one Coke.

    A small pizza topped with mushrooms, peppers, and olives, along with one Coke,
    costs $11.50.

    Your order will be ready in 15 minutes. Please visit our shop at 23 Main Street,
    NY. Your order ID is 65c278.'
