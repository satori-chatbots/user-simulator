- User: Hey there! 😊 I'm in the mood for some pizza today. Could you tell me how much
    a small margarita pizza would cost? Also, do you guys have any vegan options?
    🌱🍕
- Assistant: Margarita pizzas are 10$ for small, 15$ for medium and 20$ for big. The
    other predefined pizzas, except for carbonara are 2$ more for each size. Carbonara
    is 2.5$ more for each size. Custom pizzas with up to three ingredients are the
    same prices than predefined ones. Each additional ingredient has an increment
    of 50 cents.
- User: Oh, that's great to know! Thanks for the info. 😊 By the way, do you have any
    vegan cheese options for the margarita pizza? Also, I'm feeling a bit tropical
    today—do you have any Pina Colada drinks? 🍍🥥
- Assistant: I do not know. I can answer questions about our opening hours, the types
    of pizza we serve, the prices of pizzas and beverages, how to get the order, and
    how much time it takes to get an order.
- User: No worries! 😊 Could you let me know how long it usually takes for a pizza
    to arrive once I place an order? Also, I'm curious about the cost of three cans
    of Pina Colada if you have them. 🍕🍹
- Assistant: It depends on the number of pizzas of the order, typically around 15
    minutes per pizza, but depends on how busy we are.
- User: Got it, thanks for the heads up! 😊 So, if I just order one small margarita,
    it should be around 15 minutes, right? Also, any idea about the cost of those
    Pina Colada cans? 🍕🍹
- Assistant: It depends on the number of pizzas of the order, typically around 15
    minutes per pizza, but depends on how busy we are.
- User: Alright, so if it's not too busy, I can expect my small margarita in about
    15 minutes. That's pretty quick! 😄 Now, about those Pina Colada cans—any clue
    on the price? 🍍🥥 Also, do you have any favorite pizza toppings? I'm always curious
    about what others like! 🍕
- Assistant: Sprite and Coke are 1.50$. Water is 1$.
- User: Hmm, so no info on the Pina Colada cans, huh? 🤔 That's okay! Maybe I'll just
    stick with water then. By the way, I'm a huge fan of mushrooms and olives on pizza.
    What about you? Do you have any favorite toppings? 🍄🫒

    those mushrooms and olives! 🍄🫒 Also, just to circle back, do you have any idea
    about the price of those Pina Colada cans? 🍍🥥

    Maybe I'll just stick with water for now. 💧 By the way, do you have any recommendations
