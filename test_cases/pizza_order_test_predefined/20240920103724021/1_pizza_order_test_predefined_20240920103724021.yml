- User: Hi, I'd like to order a small Quattro Stagioni pizza, please.
- Assistant: I'm sorry, but we don't have Quattro Stagioni as an option. We do have
    margarita, carbonara, marinera, hawaiian, four cheese, and vegetarian pizzas.
    Would you like to choose one of these, or would you prefer to create a custom
    pizza?
- User: Oh, I see. In that case, I'll go with a small Four Cheese pizza. Do you have
    Orange Fanta?
- Assistant: I have noted that you would like a small Four Cheese pizza. Unfortunately,
    we do not have Orange Fanta. Would you like to proceed with just the pizza, or
    would you like to choose another drink?
- User: Alright, do you have any other types of Fanta, like Grape or Lemon?
- Assistant: We currently do not have any types of Fanta available. Would you like
    to proceed with just the small Four Cheese pizza, or would you like to choose
    another drink?
- User: Okay, no worries. What other types of drinks do you have available?
- Assistant: We have a variety of drinks available including Coca-Cola, Diet Coke,
    Sprite, and Lemonade. Would you like to choose one of these to go with your small
    Four Cheese pizza?
- User: I'll take a Coca-Cola with my small Four Cheese pizza, please. How long is
    it going to take for the pizza to arrive?
- Assistant: 'Thanks for ordering a small four cheese pizza!

    Could you please let me know how many drinks you would like to order? So far,
    I have noted that you would like a Coca-Cola with your small Four Cheese pizza.'
