- User: Hey there! I hope you're having a great day. 😊 I'm craving some pizza and
    thinking about ordering a small Quattro Stagioni pizza. Do you have that? Also,
    I'm in the mood for something fizzy to drink. Do you guys have Sprite?
- Assistant: I'm sorry, I did not get what you said. Can you rephrase?
- User: Sure thing! 😊 I'm looking to order a small Quattro Stagioni pizza. Do you
    have that on your menu? And I'm also wondering if you have Sprite as a drink option.
- Assistant: "I'm sorry, but we don't have Quattro Stagioni on our menu. We do have\
    \ a selection of predefined pizzas: margarita, carbonara, marinera, hawaiian,\
    \ four cheese, and vegetarian. Would you like to choose one of these, or would\
    \ you prefer to create a custom pizza with your choice of toppings? \n\nAs for\
    \ drinks, we do have Sprite available."
- User: 'Oh bummer, no Quattro Stagioni? 😔 Okay, I''ll go with a Four Cheese pizza
    then. 🍕 And awesome, I''ll definitely get a Sprite with that.


    By the way, how long do you think it will take for the pizza to arrive? 🕒'
- Assistant: Could you please let me know the size of the pizza you'd like? The available
    sizes are small, medium, and large.
- User: Oops, my bad! I forgot to mention, I want a small Four Cheese pizza. 😊 How
    long will it take to arrive? 🕒
- Assistant: 'Thanks for ordering a small four cheese pizza!

    Could you please let me know how many drinks you would like to order? So far,
    I have noted that you want a Sprite.'
- User: Just one Sprite will do, thanks! 😁 How long do you think the delivery will
    take? 🕒 And also, what’s the total cost for the small Four Cheese pizza and the
    Sprite? 💸
- Assistant: "Thanks for ordering a small four cheese pizza!\nThank you for confirming\
    \ the number of drinks. You have ordered 1 Sprite. \n\nRegarding your questions:\n\
    - The delivery time typically takes around 30-45 minutes.\n- The total cost for\
    \ a small Four Cheese pizza and one Sprite is $12.50.\n\nWould you like to proceed\
    \ with the order?"
