    pizza, please? Also, do you have Orange Fanta? 😊
- Assistant: It looks like you want a small Margherita pizza. Is that correct?
- User: Yes, that's right! A small Margherita sounds perfect. And do you have Orange
    Fanta? 😋 By the way, how long will it take for the pizza to arrive?
- Assistant: 'Thanks for ordering a small margarita pizza!

    Unfortunately, we don''t have Orange Fanta. Could you please let me know how many
    drinks you would like and which ones? We have coke, sprite, and water.'
- User: Oh, bummer about the Orange Fanta! I guess I'll go with a Coke then. 😊 How
    much will the pizza and drink cost altogether? Also, do you guys have any cool
    toppings or sides you'd recommend?
- Assistant: 'Sure, I''ve received your order for one Coke.

    The cost of a small margarita pizza and one Coke is $11.50.
