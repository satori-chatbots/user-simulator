- User: 'Hey there! 👋 I''m craving some pizza tonight. Can I get a small Quattro Stagioni
    pizza, please? 😊 Also, do you guys have Sprite?


    By the way, how''s your day going?'
- Assistant: I'm sorry, I did not get what you said. Can you rephrase?
- User: Sure thing! I'd like a small Quattro Stagioni pizza, please. 😊 And do you
    have Sprite available? How's your day going so far?
- Assistant: "I'm sorry, but we don't have Quattro Stagioni pizza on our menu. We\
    \ do have margarita, carbonara, marinera, hawaiian, four cheese, and vegetarian\
    \ pizzas. Would you like to choose one of these, or would you prefer to create\
    \ a custom pizza with your favorite toppings?\n\nAs for drinks, we can check if\
    \ Sprite is available once you've decided on your pizza. \n\nMy day is going well,\
    \ thank you for asking! How can I assist you further?"
- User: 'Oh, bummer about the Quattro Stagioni. 😅 You know what, I''ll go for a four
    cheese pizza then—that sounds delicious! 🍕 And please check if you have Sprite.


    By the way, do you like pizza too? What''s your favorite kind?'
- Assistant: Sure, a four cheese pizza sounds great! Could you please let me know
    what size you'd like? We have small, medium, and large.
- User: 'I''ll stick with a small four cheese pizza, thanks! 🍕 And don''t forget to
    check if you have Sprite.


    So, do you have a favorite pizza? 🍕 Or maybe a favorite topping?'
- Assistant: "Thanks for ordering a small four cheese pizza!\nThank you for your order\
    \ of a small four cheese pizza! \U0001F355 \n\nTo complete your order, could you\
    \ please let me know how many drinks you'd like and confirm if you'd like Sprite?\
    \ We have coke, sprite, and water available."
- User: 'You can add just one Sprite for me, please! 🥤


    And hey, do you know how long it''ll take for the pizza to get here? ⏰ Also, got
    any fun plans for the weekend? 😊'
