- User: 'Hi, I''d like to order a small margarita pizza, please. How much will it
    cost?


    Also, do you have c, o, k, e available as a drink option?'
- Assistant: Margarita pizzas are 10$ for small, 15$ for medium and 20$ for big. The
    other predefined pizzas, except for carbonara are 2$ more for each size. Carbonara
    is 2.5$ more for each size. Custom pizzas with up to three ingredients are the
    same prices than predefined ones. Each additional ingredient has an increment
    of 50 cents.
- User: Thanks for the price information on the margarita pizza. And what about the
    c, o, k, e? Do you have that available?
- Assistant: I do not know. I can answer questions about our opening hours, types
    of pizza we serve, prices of pizzas, prices of beverages, how to get the order,
    and how much time it takes to get an order.
- User: Thanks for the info! Can you tell me how long it will take for the small margarita
    pizza to arrive?
- Assistant: It depends on the number of pizzas of the order, typically around 15
    minutes per pizza, but depends on how busy we are.
- User: Got it, thanks! So if I just order one small margarita pizza, I should expect
    it in about 15 minutes? Also, what types of beverages do you have available?
- Assistant: I do not know. I can answer questions about our opening hours, types
    of pizza we serve, prices of pizzas, prices of beverages, how to get the order,
    and how much time it takes to get an order.
- User: Okay, I understand. Can you tell me the prices of beverages then? And by the
    way, how do I get my order?
- Assistant: Sprite and Coke are 1.50$. Water is 1$.
