- User: "Hi, um, can I get, you know, the small one... the pizza? Uh, margarita, I\
    \ think. Also, hmm, what was that drink... s, p, something... sprite? Yeah, that.\
    \ And, uh, how long does it take, do you think? \n\nOh, wait, how much is it?\
    \ The cost, I mean."
- Assistant: Margarita pizzas are 10$ for small, 15$ for medium and 20$ for big. The
    other predefined pizzas, except for carbonara are 2$ more for each size. Carbonara
    is 2.5$ more for each size. Custom pizzas with up to three ingredients are the
    same prices than predefined ones. Each additional ingredient has an increment
    of 50 cents.
- User: Wait, wait, so if I want that drink with the s, p, r, i, t, e, how much is
    that? And, um, you said something about ingredients but I just want, like, the
    small margarita... So, 10$, right? But... how long for it to get here?
- Assistant: Sprite and Coke are 1.50$. Water is 1$.
- User: Oh, hmm, okay, so 1.50$ for the drink. And, um, just to be clear, the small
    margarita is 10$, right? But you didn't say how long it takes. Like, if I order
    now, when will it get here?
- Assistant: It depends on the number of pizzas of the order, typically around 15
    minutes per pizza, but depends on how busy we are.
- User: Oh, alright, so... 10$ for the small margarita, and the drink is 1.50$, got
    it. So, um, if I order now, it's like... 15 minutes per pizza, but what if you're
    busy? Will it take longer? And also, do you guys have, uh, garlic bread or something?
    I mean, on the side.
- Assistant: It depends on the number of pizzas of the order, typically around 15
    minutes per pizza, but depends on how busy we are.
- User: Okay, uh, so if it's busy it could take longer, right? But, like, how much
    longer? Also, um, do you have garlic bread? How much is that? And, do you serve
    any dips with the pizza? Or extra cheese, maybe?
- Assistant: I do not know. I can answer questions about our opening hours, types
    of pizza we serve, prices of the pizzas, prices of the beverages, how to get the
    order, and how much time it takes to get an order.
