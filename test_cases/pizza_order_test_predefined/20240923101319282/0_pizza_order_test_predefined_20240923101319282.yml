- User: Oh, hello there, young whippersnapper! I'm tryin' to get myself one of them
    small Margarita pizzas, if you don't mind. Can you help an old timer out?
- Assistant: It looks like you have already provided the pizza type as "Margarita"
    and the size as "small". Is there anything else you would like to add or change?
- User: Ah, yes, thank you, dearie. Now, I seem to be wantin' one of those fizzy drinks.
    The one with the red label, starts with a 'C' and rhymes with 'joke.' Can you
    add one of those for me?
- Assistant: 'Thanks for ordering a small margarita pizza!

    Sure, I can add a Coke for you. How many drinks would you like to add?'
- User: Oh, bless your heart, just one of those will do. Now, how long is it goin'
    to take for that pizza to get here? And, if you don't mind me askin', how much
    will it all cost?
- Assistant: 'Sure, I''ve received your order for one Coke.

    The cost of a small margarita pizza and one Coke is $11.50.

    around much these days. Do you folks do deliveries, or do I have to come pick
    it up myself?

- User: Oh, that's a bit of a pickle for me. Is there any way you can make an exception
    for an old-timer like myself, or maybe you know a service that could bring it
    to my door?
