- User: Hi, Iâ€™d like to order a small Quattro Stagioni pizza.
- Assistant: I'm sorry, I did not get what you said. Can you rephrase?
- User: I want to order a small Quattro Stagioni pizza.
- Assistant: I see you want a small pizza. Could you please specify the toppings you
    would like? The available options are cheese, mushrooms, pepper, ham, bacon, pepperoni,
    olives, corn, and chicken.
- User: I want a small Quattro Stagioni. It already has specific toppings. How much
    will it cost?
- Assistant: At Fast Pizza, we currently offer custom pizzas where you can choose
    your own toppings. Could you please specify the toppings you would like on your
    small pizza? The available options are cheese, mushrooms, pepper, ham, bacon,
    pepperoni, olives, corn, and chicken. Once I have that information, I can help
    you with the cost.
- User: I specifically want a Quattro Stagioni pizza. It has mushrooms, ham, artichokes,
    and olives. How much will it cost?
- Assistant: 'I understand you want a Quattro Stagioni pizza with mushrooms, ham,
    artichokes, and olives. However, we don''t have artichokes as an available topping.
    Would you like to replace artichokes with another topping from the available options:
    cheese, pepper, bacon, pepperoni, corn, or chicken?'
- User: I don't want to replace anything. Just tell me how much it will cost with
    the mushrooms, ham, and olives.
- Assistant: "I apologize, but we currently do not have a specific Quattro Stagioni\
    \ pizza on our menu. However, I can help you create a custom pizza with mushrooms,\
    \ ham, and olives. \n\nWould you like to proceed with a custom small pizza with\
    \ these toppings? If so, I can provide you with the cost."
