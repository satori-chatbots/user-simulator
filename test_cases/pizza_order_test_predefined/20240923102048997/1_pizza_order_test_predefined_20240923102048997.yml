- User: I want a small Quattro Stagioni pizza. Make it fast, got it?
- Assistant: I'm sorry, but we don't have a "Quattro Stagioni" pizza on our menu.
    Would you like to choose from our predefined pizzas (margarita, carbonara, marinera,
    hawaiian, four cheese, vegetarian) or create a custom pizza?
- User: Are you kidding me? How can you not have a Quattro Stagioni pizza? Fine, give
    me a small Four Cheese pizza then. And make it quick! Do you even know what that
    means?
- Assistant: Thank you for your order! Just to confirm, you would like a small Four
    Cheese pizza. Is that correct?
- User: Yes, that's correct. And hurry up, I'm starving over here! Now, tell me, do
    you have Orange Fanta or not?
- Assistant: 'Thanks for ordering a small four cheese pizza!

    Thank you for confirming your pizza order. Unfortunately, we do not have Orange
    Fanta. Could you please let me know how many drinks you would like and which type?
    We have coke, sprite, and water.'
- User: Are you serious right now? You don't have Orange Fanta? What kind of joke
    of a place is this? Fine, just give me a Coke then. And it better be cold! How
    long is this gonna take anyway? I've got better things to do than wait around.
- Assistant: 'Sure, I''ve received your order for one Coke.

    The cost of a small four-cheese pizza and one Coke is $13.50.

- User: 15 minutes? Are you out of your mind? Why should I have to wait that long?
    Can't you do anything faster? And $13.50 for this? Are you trying to rob me? You
    better make sure it's worth it!
- Assistant: It depends on the number of pizzas of the order, typically around 15
    minutes per pizza, but depends on how busy we are.
