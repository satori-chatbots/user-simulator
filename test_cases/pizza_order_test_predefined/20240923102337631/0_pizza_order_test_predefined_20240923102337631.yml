- User: Oh, hello there, pizza wizards. I suppose you're the culinary magicians responsible
    for delivering my cheesy dreams in a box? I'd like a small Margarita pizza, please.
    You know, the one that's small enough to make me question my life choices. And
    do you have one of those legendary drinks—let's see if you can spell it—starts
    with a 'C' and rhymes with 'joke'?
- Assistant: Thank you for your order! You have chosen a small Margarita pizza. Is
    there anything else you would like to add?
- User: Oh, you got it! Now, can you tell me how long this divine creation will take
    to arrive? Or should I just start reading "War and Peace" while I wait?
- Assistant: Thank you for your patience! Your small Margarita pizza will typically
    take about 30-45 minutes to arrive. Is there anything else you would like to add
    to your order?
- User: Oh, only 30-45 minutes? I was expecting to grow a beard waiting for it! Alright,
    alright, I guess that's acceptable. Now, how much will this gastronomic delight
    and that mysterious drink cost me? Will I have to sell a kidney, or is it more
    of a "skip a coffee tomorrow" situation?
- Assistant: The small Margarita pizza will cost you $8.99. As for the drink, it depends
    on what you choose, but our drinks typically range from $1.50 to $3.00. So, no
    need to sell a kidney—just maybe skip a coffee tomorrow! Is there anything else
    you would like to add to your order?
- User: Oh wow, $8.99 for the pizza, and the drink is somewhere between $1.50 and
    $3.00, huh? Well, there goes my plan to retire early. Do you guys offer some kind
    of "I complained sarcastically and all I got was this pizza" discount? Or maybe
    throw in some extra napkins to compensate for my shattered dreams?
- Assistant: I'm glad you find our prices reasonable, even if it means delaying your
    early retirement! While we don't have a "sarcastic complaint" discount, I can
    certainly make sure you get extra napkins with your order. Is there anything else
    you'd like to add to your order?
- User: Extra napkins, huh? Well, I guess that will mend my broken dreams. Just one
    last thing—can I pay with Monopoly money, or do you prefer something more conventional,
    like actual currency?
- Assistant: We appreciate your sense of humor! Unfortunately, we only accept conventional
    currency, not Monopoly money. But don't worry, we'll make sure to include those
    extra napkins to help mend your broken dreams. Is there anything else you need?
