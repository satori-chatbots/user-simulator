- User: Oh joy, another day, another pizza order. Can I get a small cuattro stagioni
    pizza? You know, the one where they cram four seasons into one little pizza. Do
    they use time travel for that or just a really talented chef?
- Assistant: I'm sorry, I did not get what you said. Can you rephrase?
- User: 'Oh wow, a pizza shop that''s not familiar with their own menu? You guys are
    really keeping the mystery alive. Alright, let’s keep it simple: a small cuattro
    stagioni pizza, please. And while you''re at it, can I get a drink? I hope you
    can spell this one: S, P, R, I, T, E.'
- Assistant: I'm sorry, but we don't have a "cuattro stagioni" pizza on our menu.
    We do have predefined options like margarita, carbonara, marinera, hawaiian, four
    cheese, and vegetarian. Would you like to choose one of these, or would you prefer
    to create a custom pizza with your choice of toppings? And yes, we can definitely
    add a Sprite to your order.
- User: "Oh boy, a pizza place that's never heard of the cuattro stagioni. What a\
    \ plot twist! Alright then, I'll settle for a four cheese pizza, since apparently\
    \ four cheeses are less complicated than four seasons. And yes, I'd still like\
    \ that Sprite. \n\nNow, I'm dying to know, how long is this culinary adventure\
    \ going to take? Are we talking minutes, hours, or should I just prepare for hibernation\
    \ while I wait?"
- Assistant: I see you've chosen a four cheese pizza. Could you please let me know
    the size you'd like? Your options are small, medium, or large.
- User: 'Oh, I thought I already gave you a hint with the whole "small cuattro stagioni"
    thing, but hey, let''s go for a small four cheese pizza. And don''t forget that
    Sprite, because nothing pairs with pizza like some sugar and bubbles. Now, back
    to my burning question: Should I set up camp by the door, or do I have time to
    start a new Netflix series before my food arrives?'
- Assistant: 'Thanks for ordering a small four cheese pizza!

    Thank you for your patience! Just to confirm, you would like one Sprite with your
    small four cheese pizza. Could you please let me know the total number of drinks
    you''d like to order?'
- User: Oh, sure, let's add some suspense to the drink order too. Just one Sprite,
    please. I don’t want to get too crazy tonight. Now, seriously, how long is this
    masterpiece going to take? Should I be looking out for a time-traveling pizza
    delivery guy or just a regular one?
- Assistant: 'Thanks for ordering a small four cheese pizza!

    Thank you for confirming your order! You have ordered one small four cheese pizza
    and one Sprite. Your order will be ready in approximately 30 minutes. Is there
    anything else I can assist you with?'
