    anything else you would like to add to your order?

- Assistant: I'm sorry, but I can only assist with pizza orders at the moment. Would
    you like to add another pizza to your order? If so, please let me know the type
    and size.

    I can confirm your order for a small margarita pizza. However, I need to know
