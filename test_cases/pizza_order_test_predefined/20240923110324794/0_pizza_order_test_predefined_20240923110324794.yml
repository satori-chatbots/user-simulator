- User: Hi there! I'd like to order a small margarita pizza. Could you tell me if
    you have Sprite available?
- Assistant: I do not know. I can answer questions about our opening hours, types
    of pizza we serve, prices of pizzas and beverages, how to get the order, and how
    much time it takes to get an order.
- User: Okay, can you tell me how long it will take for the small margarita pizza
    to arrive?
- Assistant: It depends on the number of pizzas of the order, typically around 15
    minutes per pizza, but depends on how busy we are.
- User: 'User: Alright, got it. Could you then confirm the price for a small margarita
    pizza?'
- Assistant: Margarita pizzas are 10$ for small, 15$ for medium and 20$ for big. The
    other predefined pizzas, except for carbonara are 2$ more for each size. Carbonara
    is 2.5$ more for each size. Custom pizzas with up to three ingredients are the
    same prices than predefined ones. Each additional ingredient has an increment
    of 50 cents.
- User: Okay, thanks for the info. Just to confirm, do you have Sprite available?
- Assistant: I do not know. I can answer questions about our opening hours, types
    of pizza we serve, prices of pizzas and beverages, how to get the order, and how
    much time it takes to get an order.
- User: That's a bit frustrating. Could you at least tell me the price of Sprite if
    it's available?
- Assistant: Sprite and Coke are 1.50$. Water is 1$.
