- User: Hi there! I'd like to order a small Quattro Stagioni pizza, please.
- Assistant: I'm sorry, but we don't have a "Quattro Stagioni" pizza on our menu.
    Would you like to choose from our predefined pizzas (margarita, carbonara, marinera,
    hawaiian, four cheese, vegetarian) or create a custom pizza?
- User: Do you have any pizzas similar to a Quattro Stagioni? Maybe with artichokes,
    ham, mushrooms, and olives?
- Assistant: We don't have a predefined pizza exactly like the Quattro Stagioni, but
    you can create a custom pizza with artichokes, ham, mushrooms, and olives. Would
    you like to proceed with a custom pizza?
- User: Yes, I'd like to proceed with a custom pizza with those toppings. How much
    would that cost?
- Assistant: Could you please specify the size of the pizza you'd like (small, medium,
    or large) and the toppings you want (cheese, mushrooms, pepper, ham, bacon, pepperoni,
    olives, corn, chicken)?
- User: I'd like a small pizza with artichokes, ham, mushrooms, and olives. How much
    will that cost?
- Assistant: 'Thanks for ordering a small pizza with ham, mushrooms and olives!

    Could you please let me know how many drinks you would like to order and which
    drinks you prefer? The available options are coke, sprite, and water.'
- User: I wanted an Orange Fanta, actually. Do you have that?
- Assistant: I'm sorry, but we only have coke, sprite, and water available. Could
    you please choose one of these options and let me know how many drinks you would
    like to order?
