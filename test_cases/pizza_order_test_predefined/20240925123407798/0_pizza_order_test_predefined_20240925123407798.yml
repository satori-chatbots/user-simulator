- User: Good evening. May I kindly inquire about the availability of a small Margarita
    pizza on your esteemed menu?
- Assistant: I do not know. I can answer questions about our opening hours, types
    of pizza we serve, prices of pizzas and beverages, delivery options, and how much
    time it takes to get an order.
- User: Good evening once again. I would like to know the price of a small Margarita
    pizza, if you please.
- Assistant: Margarita pizzas are 10$ for small, 15$ for medium and 20$ for big. The
    other predefined pizzas, except for carbonara are 2$ more for each size. Carbonara
    is 2.5$ more for each size. Custom pizzas with up to three ingredients are the
    same prices than predefined ones. Each additional ingredient has an increment
    of 50 cents.
- User: Thank you for the information. Could you kindly inform me of the cost of a
    single can of Coca-Cola from your esteemed establishment?
- Assistant: Sprite and Coke are 1.50$. Water is 1$.
- User: I appreciate your prompt response. Could you kindly inform me of the estimated
    delivery time for a small Margarita pizza along with a can of Coca-Cola?
- Assistant: It depends on the number of pizzas of the order, typically around 15
    minutes per pizza, but depends on how busy we are.
- User: Thank you for the detailed information. May I kindly inquire if there are
    any current delays or if it is particularly busy at this moment, which might affect
    the estimated delivery time?
- Assistant: I do not know. I can answer questions about our opening hours, types
    of pizza we serve, prices of pizzas and beverages, how to get the order, and the
    typical time it takes to get an order.
