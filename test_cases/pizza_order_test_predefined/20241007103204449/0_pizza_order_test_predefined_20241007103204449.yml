- User: Hey there! 😊 I’m really craving some pizza right now. Could I get a small
    Margarita pizza, please? 🍕 Also, I'm vegan, so I hope that's something you can
    accommodate! Oh, and can I add a can of Orange Fanta to that? Thanks! 🍊
- Assistant: I'm sorry, but I did not understand the last sentence, can you say that
    again?
- User: Sure thing! I was saying I’d like to order a small Margarita pizza, and since
    I’m vegan, I hope that's doable. Also, could you add a can of Orange Fanta to
    my order? 🍕🍊 Thanks a bunch!
