- User: Hey there! 😊 I was just asking if you have vegan cheese options for a small
    margarita pizza. 🌱

    vegan cheese options for that? 🤞🌱

    to offer vegan cheese options for that? Fingers crossed! 🤞🌱 Also, what’s the deal
    with your Sprite? Is it in cans or bottles? 😄
- Assistant: I'm sorry, I did not get what you said. Can you rephrase?
- User: Hey there! 😊 So, I'm really hoping you have vegan cheese for the small margarita
    pizza. It would totally make my day! 🌱 Also, I'm curious, do you serve Sprite
    in cans or bottles? 😋
- Assistant: I'm sorry, I did not get what you said. Can you rephrase?
- User: Hey there! 😊 I'm really hoping you have vegan cheese for the small margarita
    pizza. It would totally be awesome! 🌱 Also, I'm curious, do you serve Sprite in
    cans or bottles? 😋
- Assistant: I'm sorry, I did not get what you said. Can you rephrase?
- User: Hey! 🍕 So, I’m really hoping you guys have some vegan cheese for that small
    margarita pizza. It'd be a game-changer! 🌱 How about the Sprite? Do you serve
    it in cans or bottles? I’m kinda particular about that. 😄
- Assistant: I'm sorry, I did not get what you said. Can you rephrase?
- User: Hey! 😊 You know, I’m seriously hoping you guys have vegan cheese for that
    small margarita pizza. It would be such a win! 🌿 Also, I’m kinda curious if your
    Sprite is served in cans or bottles? Sometimes it makes a difference, you know?
    😅
- Assistant: I'm sorry, I did not get what you said. Can you rephrase?
- User: Hey there! 😊 I'm still on the hunt for that small margarita pizza with vegan
    cheese. Any chance that's an option? 🌱 Also, do you serve Sprite in cans or bottles?
    I'm a bit of a can enthusiast, haha. 😄
- Assistant: Hi there! 😊 It looks like you're interested in a small margarita pizza.
    However, we don't have vegan cheese as an option. Would you like to proceed with
    the regular margarita pizza? Also, regarding your question about Sprite, we serve
    it in cans. Let me know if you'd like to place an order! 🍕🥤
- User: Oh, bummer about the vegan cheese! 😅 I was really hoping for that. But hey,
    thanks for letting me know about the Sprite cans—love those! Out of curiosity,
    how long does it typically take for the pizza to arrive once I place the order?
    ⏰🍕
- Assistant: You're welcome! 😊 Once you place your order, it typically takes about
    30 to 45 minutes for the pizza to arrive, depending on your location and the time
    of day. If you decide to go ahead with the regular margarita pizza, just let me
    know, and I'll be happy to assist you with the order! 🍕⏰
- User: Got it, thanks for the info! 30 to 45 minutes isn't too bad. 😊 Okay, so if
    I order a small margarita pizza and a can of Sprite, how much will that set me
    back? Just curious before I decide! 💸🍕🥤
- Assistant: The cost for a small margarita pizza and a can of Sprite will depend
    on our current pricing. Unfortunately, I don't have access to the pricing information
    at the moment. However, you can check our menu or contact the shop directly for
    the most accurate pricing. Let me know if you'd like to proceed with the order!
    🍕🥤
