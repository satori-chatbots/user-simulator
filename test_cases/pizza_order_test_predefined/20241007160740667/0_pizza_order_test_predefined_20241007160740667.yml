- User: Hey there, pizza lover here! üçï I'm thinking about ordering a small Carbonara
    pizza. Do you think that's a good choice? Also, got any recommendations for a
    good drink to go with it? üòä
- Assistant: Welcome to Fast Pizza! I'm a chatbot assistant that can help you order
    pizzas and drinks. A small Carbonara pizza is a delicious choice! As for a drink,
    you might enjoy a refreshing soda or perhaps a nice iced tea to complement the
    flavors. What would you like to do next?
- User: That sounds awesome! I think I'll go with a can of Coke. üçïü•§ By the way, how
    long do you think it'll take for the pizza to arrive? I'm already getting hungry
    just thinking about it! üòã
- Assistant: It depends on the number of pizzas of the order, typically around 15
    minutes per pizza, but depends on how busy we are.
- User: Oh, 15 minutes sounds pretty quick! I'm getting excited already. üòÑ Do you
    know how much the small Carbonara pizza and the can of Coke will cost together?
    Just want to make sure I have enough to cover it. Also, do you have any favorite
    pizza toppings? üçÑ
- Assistant: Margarita pizzas are 10$ for small, 15$ for medium and 20$ for big. The
    other predefined pizzas, except for carbonara are 2$ more for each size. Carbonara
    is 2.5$ more for each size. Custom pizzas with up to three ingredients are the
    same prices than predefined ones. Each additional ingredient has an increment
    of 50 cents.
