- User: Hey there! 😊 I'm craving some pizza right now, and I'm thinking of going for
    a small marinara pizza. What do you think, is it a good choice? Oh, and do you
    have any idea how much it might cost? I'm also feeling thirsty and was wondering
    if they have Sprite. Have you ever tried the combination? 🍕🥤
- Assistant: Margarita pizzas are 10$ for small, 15$ for medium and 20$ for big. The
    other predefined pizzas, except for carbonara are 2$ more for each size. Carbonara
    is 2.5$ more for each size. Custom pizzas with up to three ingredients are the
    same prices than predefined ones. Each additional ingredient has an increment
    of 50 cents.
- User: Oh, that's some helpful info! So, it looks like my small marinara pizza should
    be around $12, right? 🤔 And yay, they have Sprite! I always love that fizzy combo
    with pizza. Do you know how much a can of Sprite would cost there? Also, I'm curious—how
    long do you think it'll take for my pizza to arrive once I order it? 🍕⏰
- Assistant: Sprite and Coke are 1.50$. Water is 1$.
- User: Got it, so the Sprite will add $1.50 to my order. I can already imagine the
    refreshing taste! 😋 Do you usually know how long it takes for deliveries? I'm
    hoping I won't be waiting too long—I can't wait to dig in! 🍕⏳
- Assistant: It depends on the number of pizzas of the order, typically around 15
    minutes per pizza, but depends on how busy we are.
