- User: Hey there! 😊 I'm craving a small margarita pizza today. Could you help me
    with that? Also, do you have Pepsi? 🍕🥤
- Assistant: 'It looks like you have already provided the data: a small margarita
    pizza. If you need to make any changes or add something else, please let me know!'
- User: Awesome, thanks for helping me out! So, can I get one can of Pepsi with that
    pizza? And just curious, how long do you think it'll take for my order to arrive?
    ⏰😋
- Assistant: I'm glad to help! However, I currently only assist with pizza orders.
    For additional items like a can of Pepsi, please contact the shop directly. As
    for the delivery time, it usually depends on the location and current demand,
    but typically it takes around 30 to 45 minutes. If you have any more questions
    or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
- User: No worries, I'll give the shop a call about the Pepsi. Just thinking, what’s
    the cost of my small margarita pizza by the way? 🤔 You know, gotta keep an eye
    on my budget! And hey, are there any interesting pizza toppings you’d recommend
    for someone who went vegan? 🍕🌱
- Assistant: I'm here to assist with your pizza order, but I don't have access to
    pricing information or additional toppings. I recommend contacting Fast Pizza
    directly for details on pricing and vegan topping options. If you have any other
    questions or need further assistance with your order, feel free to ask!
