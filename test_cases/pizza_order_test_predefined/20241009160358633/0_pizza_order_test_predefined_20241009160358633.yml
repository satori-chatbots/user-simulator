- User: Hey there! üòä I'm thinking about ordering a pizza tonight, and I'm curious
    about your BBQ options. Do you have a small BBQ pizza available? üçï And oh, I could
    really use a can of Coca-Cola too! How's your day going, by the way?
- Assistant: I'm sorry, we don't have a BBQ pizza as a predefined option. However,
    you can choose from our predefined pizzas like margarita, carbonara, marinera,
    hawaiian, four cheese, and vegetarian. Alternatively, you can create a custom
    pizza with your choice of toppings. Would you like to choose one of these options
    or create a custom pizza?
- User: Oh, bummer! I was really craving some BBQ flavors. ü§î Maybe I can create a
    custom pizza with some BBQ sauce and my favorite veggies. That could be fun! How
    about I go with a vegetarian pizza and add some BBQ sauce to it? Also, I still
    want that can of Coca-Cola to wash it down. üòã How long would it take for my pizza
    to arrive once I place the order?
- Assistant: It looks like I need some more information to help you with your order.
    Could you please let me know the size of the pizza you'd like (small, medium,
    or large) and the toppings you want (choose from cheese, mushrooms, pepper, ham,
    bacon, pepperoni, olives, corn, chicken)?
- User: Sure thing! I'd love a small pizza with BBQ sauce, mushrooms, olives, and
    corn. üçï Just thinking about it is making me hungry! How about you, what's your
    favorite pizza topping? üòÑ And don't forget my can of Coca-Cola! Also, could you
    let me know how much the total cost would be?
- Assistant: 'Thanks for ordering a small pizza with mushrooms, olives and corn!

    Could you please let me know how many drinks you would like to order? '
