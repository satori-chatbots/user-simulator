- User: Hey there! ðŸ˜Š I'm feeling a bit peckish and was thinking about ordering some
    pizza. I'm a vegan, so do you have any small BBQ pizzas that are vegan-friendly?
    Also, just wondering if I can get a can of Pepsi with that. How long does it usually
    take for delivery? ðŸ¤”
- Assistant: We have Margarita, Carbonara, Marinera, Hawaiian, Four cheese, Vegetarian,
    and Custom (you choose the ingredients)
