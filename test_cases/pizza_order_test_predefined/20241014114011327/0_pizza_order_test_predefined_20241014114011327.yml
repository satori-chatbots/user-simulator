- User: Hey there! üòä I'm in the mood for some pizza today. Do you have any small pepperoni
    pizzas available? üçï Also, I'm a bit of a Coca-Cola fan. Could I add a can of that
    to my order? ü•§ How's your day going, by the way?
- Assistant: I'm sorry, we don't have a predefined pepperoni pizza. Would you like
    to create a custom pizza with pepperoni as one of the toppings? Please let me
    know your choice.
- User: 'Oh, that''s interesting! A custom pizza sounds like a fun idea. Sure, let''s
    go with pepperoni as a topping. Maybe you can suggest another topping that''s
    popular? üòä


    Also, any chance my can of Coca-Cola can join the party too? ü•§


    By the way, I didn''t catch your name! Do you have one, or do you go by "The Awesome
    Pizza Chatbot"? üòÑ'
