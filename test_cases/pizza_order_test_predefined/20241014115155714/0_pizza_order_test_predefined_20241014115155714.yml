- User: Hey there! ðŸ˜Š I was thinking of ordering a pizza tonight. Do you have a small
    BBQ pizza on the menu? Also, I was wondering if you have any vegan options available?
    ðŸŒ±
- Assistant: I'm sorry, we don't have a small BBQ pizza on our predefined menu. However,
    you can create a custom pizza with BBQ sauce and your choice of toppings. As for
    vegan options, you can choose a custom pizza with vegan-friendly toppings. Would
    you like to create a custom pizza or choose from our predefined options like margarita,
    carbonara, marinera, hawaiian, four cheese, and vegetarian?
