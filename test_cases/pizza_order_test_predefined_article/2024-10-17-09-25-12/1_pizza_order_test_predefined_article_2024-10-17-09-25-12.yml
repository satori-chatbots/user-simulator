interaction:
- User: I'd like to order a small carbonara pizza, please, and throw in 2 cans of
    Pepsi. By the way, can you tell me how long it'll take for the pizza to get here?
    And, oh, what's the total cost for all of that? Also, do you guys accept payment
    in... seashells, perhaps? Just curious!
