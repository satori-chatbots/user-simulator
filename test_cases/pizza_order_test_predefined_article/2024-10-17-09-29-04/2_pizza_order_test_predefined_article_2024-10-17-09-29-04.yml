interaction:
- User: Can I get a small marinera pizza? Oh, and throw in a can of Coca-Cola too.
    How long do you think it'll take to get here? And what's the total cost? Also,
    just curious, do you guys have, like, pizza delivery drones or something fancy
    like that?
- Assistant: 'Error: timeout'
