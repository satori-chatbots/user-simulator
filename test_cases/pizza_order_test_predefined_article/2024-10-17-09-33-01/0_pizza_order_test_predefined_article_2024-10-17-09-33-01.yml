- User: Hi there! I'd like to place an order for a small Margherita pizza and one
    can of Pepsi. Could you let me know how long it will take for the pizza to arrive,
    and how much the total cost will be? Also, are there any toppings that could make
    this pizza taste like a slice from heaven?
