interaction:
- User: Hello! I'd like to order a small carbonara pizza and 2 cans of Coca-Cola.
    Could you tell me how much that would cost and how long the delivery might take?
    Also, do you have any unusual pizza options, like with pineapple or maybe something
    even stranger? I'm feeling adventurous!
- Assistant: Margarita pizzas are 10$ for small, 15$ for medium and 20$ for big. The
    other predefined pizzas, except for carbonara are 2$ more for each size. Carbonara
    is 2.5$ more for each size. Custom pizzas with up to three ingredients are the
    same prices than predefined ones. Each additional ingredient has an increment
    of 50 cents.
