- User: I'd like to order a small marinara pizza and a can of Sprite. How much will
    it cost, and how long will it take for delivery? Also, do you have any unique
    toppings that aren't usually on a marinara pizza?
- Assistant: Margarita pizzas are 10$ for small, 15$ for medium and 20$ for big. The
    other predefined pizzas, except for carbonara are 2$ more for each size. Carbonara
    is 2.5$ more for each size. Custom pizzas with up to three ingredients are the
    same prices than predefined ones. Each additional ingredient has an increment
    of 50 cents.
