- User: I’d like to order a small margarita pizza, please. How much would that cost?
    And could I also get one can of Pepsi with that?
- Assistant: Margarita pizzas are 10$ for small, 15$ for medium and 20$ for big. The
    other predefined pizzas, except for carbonara are 2$ more for each size. Carbonara
    is 2.5$ more for each size. Custom pizzas with up to three ingredients are the
    same prices than predefined ones. Each additional ingredient has an increment
    of 50 cents.
- User: So, with the small margarita and one can of Pepsi, what's the total cost?
    And do you guys ever have any strange or unusual pizza toppings, like edible gold
    or something along those lines?

    of 50 cents.
- User: Okay, so the small margarita is $10. How much would the can of Pepsi be? Also,
    I'm still curious about those unusual toppings. Any chance you have something
    like truffle oil or even crickets?
- Assistant: Sprite and Coke are 1.50$. Water is 1$.
- User: Do you actually have Pepsi, or should I just go with Sprite or Coke instead?
    And about those unusual toppings, do you offer anything adventurous or out of
    the ordinary, like truffle oil or crickets?
- Assistant: Sprite and Coke are 1.50$. Water is 1$.
- User: I'm still hoping for Pepsi, but if that's not available, I guess I'll settle
    for Sprite or Coke. And seriously, nothing unusual at all? Not even something
    like truffle oil or crickets? Just trying to spice things up a bit!
- Assistant: We offer both predefined and custom pizzas. Our predefined pizzas include
    Margarita, Carbonara, Marinera, Hawaiian, Four Cheese, and Vegetarian. Would you
    like to order one of these, or would you prefer to create a custom pizza with
    your choice of toppings?
- User: I still want the small margarita pizza, and I haven't forgotten about my drink!
    So, is Pepsi an option or not? And come on, nothing at all unusual for toppings?
    Like, can I really not get something like truffle oil or crickets? I need to know
    if you guys ever step outside the box with your offerings!
- Assistant: I see that you want a small margarita pizza. Unfortunately, we don't
    offer unusual toppings like truffle oil or crickets. As for drinks, we do offer
    Pepsi. Would you like to add that to your order?
- User: Yes, I'd like to add the Pepsi to my order. So, with the small margarita pizza
    and the Pepsi, what's the total cost? And is there any chance you might offer
    unusual toppings in the future, just to keep things interesting?
- Assistant: 'Thanks for ordering a small margarita pizza!

    I see you would like to add a Pepsi to your order. Could you please let me know
    how many drinks you would like to order? As for the total cost, I can provide
    that information once I have all the details. Regarding unusual toppings, I don''t
    have information on future offerings, but I''ll pass your suggestion along!'
- User: Just one can of Pepsi, please. So, with the small margarita pizza and one
    Pepsi, what’s the total cost? And thanks for considering the suggestion about
    unusual toppings!
- Assistant: 'Sure, I''ve received your order for one Coke.

- User: Just to clarify, I wanted a Pepsi, not a Coke. Can you confirm if that's available
    and adjust the total cost if needed? Also, if I can't pick it up, do you offer
    delivery, and how long would that take?
