interaction:
- User: I'd like to order a small marinara pizza and one can of Sprite. Can you tell
    me how long it's going to take for the pizza to arrive? Also, how much will it
    cost?
- Assistant: It depends on the number of pizzas of the order, typically around 15
    minutes per pizza, but depends on how busy we are.
- User: Hmm, 15 minutes per pizza sounds a bit vague. Can you give me a more precise
    estimate for just one small marinara pizza and one can of Sprite? Also, any idea
    of the total cost, including delivery fees, if applicable?
- Assistant: It depends on the number of pizzas of the order, typically around 15
    minutes per pizza, but depends on how busy we are.
- User: I see you mentioned the same response about the timing. Can you clarify if
    that's a standard response, or is there a way to check the current wait time?
    Also, about the costâ€”are there any ongoing promotions or discounts that might
    affect the total price?
- Assistant: It depends on the number of pizzas of the order, typically around 15
    minutes per pizza, but depends on how busy we are.
- User: I noticed you keep giving the same answer about the timing. Is there a way
    to check the current queue so I can get a more accurate estimate? And regarding
    the cost, do you have any promotions, like buy-one-get-one or discounts for first-time
    customers, that might lower the price?
- Assistant: I'm sorry, I did not get what you said. Can you rephrase?
- User: I'm curious if there's any system to track the current order queue for a more
    accurate delivery time. Also, are there any ongoing promotions or first-time customer
    discounts that could reduce the cost of my order?
- Assistant: I'm sorry, I did not get what you said. Can you rephrase?
- User: Is there a way to know the exact delivery time based on the current order
    queue? And do you have any current promotions or first-time customer discounts
    that could potentially lower the cost?
- Assistant: I do not know. I can answer questions about our opening hours, types
    of pizza we serve, prices of pizzas and beverages, how to get the order, and how
    much time it typically takes to get an order.
- User: I understand the typical time, but I'm really interested in knowing the exact
    delivery time based on your current queue. Is there any specific way to find that
    out? Also, I'd appreciate any information on promotions, even if it's just a small
    discount or a deal for first-time customers.
- Assistant: It depends on the number of pizzas of the order, typically around 15
    minutes per pizza, but depends on how busy we are.
- User: I get that you're saying it typically takes around 15 minutes per pizza, but
    I'm really hoping for something more precise. Maybe a ballpark figure based on
    the current queue? Also, I'm still curious about any promotions or discounts that
    might apply to my order. Even a small saving would be great!
- Assistant: It depends on the number of pizzas of the order, typically around 15
    minutes per pizza, but depends on how busy we are.
- User: I see we're going in circles about the timing. Is there someone I can talk
    to for a more specific delivery estimate? And for the promotions, any chance I
    can find them on your website or social media pages?
- Assistant: I'm sorry, I did not get what you said. Can you rephrase?
- User: Is there a possibility to contact someone for a precise delivery estimate?
    And regarding promotions, could I find any details about them on your website
    or social media?
- Assistant: I do not know. I can answer questions about our opening hours, types
    of pizza we serve, prices of pizzas and beverages, how to get the order, and how
    much time it takes to get an order.
- User: It seems like I'm not getting the answers I need about the delivery time.
    Is there any chance I could call the store directly for a more accurate estimate?
    Also, if I visit your website or social media, would there be any section dedicated
    to promotions or discounts?
- Assistant: We do not do delivery, but customers need to get the shop for their orders.
    We are located at 23 Main Street, New York.
- User: Oh, so I need to pick up the order myself? That's good to know. But I'm still
    curious, if I decide to come by, would there be any ongoing promotions or discounts
    that I should be aware of before I arrive?
- Assistant: I do not know. I can answer questions about our opening hours, types
    of pizza we serve, prices of pizzas and beverages, how to get the order, and how
    much time it takes to get an order.
