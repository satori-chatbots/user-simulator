    about your small Margherita pizza? Also, do you have Coke in cans? üçïü•§


    By the way, how''s your day going? I hope you''re not too swamped with orders!'

- User: Oh, my bad! I totally meant a Margherita pizza. üòÖ So, what's on the small
    Margherita pizza, and do you guys offer Coca-Cola in cans? Also, what's your favorite
    pizza topping? I bet you have some pizza secrets to spill! üçïü•§
- Assistant: 'Thanks for ordering a small margarita pizza!

    Could you please let me know how many drinks you would like to order and confirm
    if you would like Coca-Cola (coke) or another drink option like sprite or water?'
- User: I think I'll just stick with one can of Coca-Cola for now, keep it simple!
    ü•§ So, what's your favorite pizza topping? I feel like everyone's got a secret
    pizza combo they love. Also, do you have any fun pizza stories to share? üçï
