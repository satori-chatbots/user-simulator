- User: 'Hey there! 😊 I''m craving some pizza right now, and I was wondering if you
    guys have a small carbonara pizza? 🍕 Also, do you have 2 cans of Sprite to go
    with that? Just trying to make the perfect meal combo here! '
- Assistant: I see that you want a small carbonara pizza. Could you please confirm
    if you would like to order any drinks or if there's anything else you'd like to
    add to your order?
- User: Oh, definitely! I mentioned those 2 cans of Sprite already. 🥤 Can't have pizza
    without a fizzy drink, right? By the way, do you guys have any crazy pizza topping
    combinations you've seen people order? I'm always up for trying something wild!
    😄
- Assistant: 'Thanks for ordering a small carbonara pizza!

    Thank you for confirming the 2 cans of Sprite. Just to make sure, could you please
    confirm the number of drinks you would like to order? Also, regarding crazy pizza
    topping combinations, we''ve seen some interesting ones like pineapple with jalapeños
    or even a dessert pizza with chocolate and marshmallows! Let me know if you''d
    like to try something unique. 😄'
