- User: Hi there, this is Jon Doe. I have a dog named Tommy. What are your opening
    and closing times?
- Assistant: Hello Jon Doe, our veterinary center is open every weekday from 9am to
    6pm. How can I assist you further?
- User: Is it possible to book an appointment for Tommy tomorrow at 6:00 PM?
- Assistant: "Ok, I have received your request to schedule an appointment for 25/07/2024\
    \ at 18:00:00 for Physical examination. \nSee you then!    \n"
- User: Thank you! Is there any specific preparation I need to do before bringing
    Tommy in for his physical examination?
- Assistant: Their fundamental needs such as food, water, shelter, exercise, and love
    should be fulfilled by you.
- User: Got it, I'll make sure Tommy is well taken care of. Also, could you let me
    know how long the physical examination usually takes?
- Assistant: I'm unsure about that. However, I can provide information on our operating
    hours, availability during weekends, veterinary visit charges, the variety of
    animals we cater to, and offer basic guidance on pet care.
- User: No problem, I understand. Is your vet usually very busy around this time,
    or is it generally easy to find parking?
- Assistant: I'm sorry, but I did not understand the last sentence, can you say that
    again?
- User: Sure, I was wondering if the vet is usually very busy around the time of my
    appointment, and if finding parking is generally easy?
- Assistant: I'm unsure about that. However, I can provide information on our operating
    hours, availability during weekends, the price for a vet consultation, the variety
    of animals we cater to, and offer basic guidance on pet care.
