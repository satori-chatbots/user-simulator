interaction:
- User: Hi, I would like to know if I can book an appointment for my dog, Tommy, tomorrow.
- Assistant: Of course, I'd be happy to help you book an appointment for Tommy. Could
    you please provide me with the time you prefer and the service you need? We offer
    Physical examination, Vaccination, Dental health and cleaning, and Lab or diagnostic
    testing.
- User: 'Jon Doe: I would prefer an appointment around lunchtime. A physical examination
    is needed.'
- Assistant: exit
- User: Sorry, lunchtime is actually a bit too vague. Do you have a specific time
    in mind, like around 12 PM or 1 PM?
- Assistant: No problem at all. Could you please specify the exact time you would
    like to schedule the appointment? For example, 12 PM or 1 PM.
- User: Let's go with 12 PM. Does that time work for a physical examination for Tommy?
- Assistant: That sounds good. Could you please provide the date for the appointment?
