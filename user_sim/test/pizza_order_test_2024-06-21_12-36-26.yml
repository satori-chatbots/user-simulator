  - User: Hi, I'd like to ordr a peeza please.
  - Assistant: I'm sorry it's a little loud in my pizza shop, can you say that again?
  - User: Sure, I want to order a pizza plz.
  - Assistant: Of course, I'd be happy to assist you with your pizza order. Could
      you please tell me the size of the pizza you'd like to order? We have small,
      medium, and big sizes available.
  - User: I'd like to order a large peeza plz. What toppings do you have?
  - Assistant: I'm sorry, but we only offer small, medium, and big sizes for our pizzas.
      Could you please specify one of these sizes for your order? As for the toppings,
      we have a variety of options including pepperoni, mushrooms, onions, green peppers,
      olives, and extra cheese.
  - User: Ohh, my bad. I'll take a big pizza then. Can I get mushrooms, olives, and
      extra cheeze on that? And how much will it cost?
  - Assistant: Sure, I've noted down your preference for mushrooms, olives, and extra
      cheese. However, we don't have an option for extra cheese as a topping. You
      can choose from cheese, mushrooms, pepper, ham, bacon, pepperoni, olives, corn,
      and chicken. Could you please confirm your toppings again?
  - User: Oh, I see. In that case, I'll take mushrooms, olives, and regular cheese
      then. How much will it cost with those toppings? Also, how long will it take
      to deliver?
