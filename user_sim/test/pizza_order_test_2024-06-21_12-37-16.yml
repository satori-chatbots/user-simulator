  - User: Hey! I'd like to order a peetza, please. Can I get a medium one?
  - Assistant: Of course, I'd be happy to assist you with your pizza order. Could
      you please tell me what toppings you'd like on your pizza? You can choose from
      cheese, mushrooms, pepper, ham, bacon, pepperoni, olives, corn, and chicken.
  - User: Hmm, let's see. Can I get pepperoni and muchrooms on that medium pizza?
      Also, do you have extra cheese option?
  - Assistant: Sure, I've noted down your preference for pepperoni and mushrooms.
      However, we don't have an option for extra cheese as a topping. You can choose
      from cheese, mushrooms, pepper, ham, bacon, pepperoni, olives, corn, and chicken.
      Could you please confirm your toppings again?
  - User: Oh, okay. Let's go with pepperoni and mushrooms then. Also, how long does
      the delivery usually take?
  - Assistant: Great, I've noted down your pizza order. Now, could you please tell
      me what drink you would like to have with your pizza? We have coke, sprite,
      and water available.
  - User: Sure, I'll take a Coke with the pizza. By the way, how much is the total
      cost for the medium pizza with pepperoni and mushrooms?
  - Assistant: Alright, your order for coke has been acknowledged. Have a great time
      with your pizza and beverages!
  - User: Wait, hold on, I still need to know the total cost for the pizza and Coke.
      And can I pay with a credit card?
