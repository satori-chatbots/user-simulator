- User: Hi! I would like to order a pizza please.
- Assistant: Of course! Could you please specify the size of the pizza you want? We
    have small, medium, and big sizes available.
- User: Oh sorry, I meant to say large! I want a large pizza. Can I have some topppings
    on it too?
- Assistant: I'm sorry for the confusion, but we only offer small, medium, and big
    sizes. Could you please specify one of these? As for the toppings, we can definitely
    discuss that once we've decided on the size of your pizza.
- User: Oh, my bad! I'll take a big pizza then. For topppings, can I get mushrooms,
    tomatoes, and extra cheese?
- Assistant: I'm sorry, but we don't have tomatoes as a topping option. We do have
    cheese and mushrooms as you requested. Other options include pepper, ham, bacon,
    pepperoni, olives, corn, and chicken. Could you please choose from these options?
- User: Hmm, okay then. Lemme see... Can I get mushrooms, extra cheese, and pepperoni
    on my pizza? And do you have any deals or offers going on right now?
- Assistant: Absolutely, your pizza with mushrooms, extra cheese, and pepperoni is
    noted. As for the deals, we currently have a combo offer where you get a drink
    with your pizza. The options are coke, sprite, or water. Which one would you prefer?
- User: Oh, that's cool! I'll go with a coke then. Also, how long is the delivery
    time usually? I'm pretty hungry!
