  and closes?'

  But before I go, can you tell me if you have any recommendations for a good bike
  shop in the area?'

  back to finding a bike shop. When I do find one, what should I look for in terms

  \ shops. Thanks for your help! \n\nWhen I do find a bike shop, I wonder about the\

  \ expect for those items?"

  When I do find a bike shop, is it usually possible to get a discount if I buy multiple
  items, like tires and seats together?'

  to ask the bike shop directly about discounts. Have a good day!'
