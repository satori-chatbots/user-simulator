    Assistant: Sure! The bike shop is open from 9 AM to 7 PM on weekdays and from
    10 AM to 5 PM on weekends.


    User: Thanks! Also, I''m curious, what''s the most expensive bike you have in
    the shop?


    Assistant: The most expensive bike we currently have is a high-end carbon fiber
    road bike that costs around $10,000. It''s designed for professional racing and
    comes with top-of-the-line components.


    User: Wow, that''s quite a price tag! What about the seats? How much do they usually
    cost?'
- Assistant: The price of seats can vary depending on the type and brand. On average,
    a good quality seat can cost anywhere from $30 to $150. It's best to visit the
    shop and check out the different options available.
- User: 'User: Thanks for the info on the seats! Do you have any recommendations for
    a comfortable seat for long-distance rides?'
- Assistant: Absolutely! For long-distance rides, I would recommend looking for a
    seat that has extra padding and ergonomic design to provide maximum comfort. Some
    popular options include the Brooks B17, Selle Anatomica X Series, and Terry Fly
    saddles. It's always a good idea to try out different seats and see which one
    feels the most comfortable for you.
