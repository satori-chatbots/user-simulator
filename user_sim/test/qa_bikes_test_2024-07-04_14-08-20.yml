- User: 'User: Hi everyone! I''m planning to visit the bike shop soon. Can anyone
    tell me the opening and closing times?


    Forum Member 1: Hey! The bike shop usually opens at 9 AM and closes at 6 PM from
    Monday to Saturday. On Sundays, they open at 10 AM and close at 4 PM.


    User: Thanks for the info! Also, I''m curious, what''s the most expensive bike
    you have in the shop?


    Forum Member 2: The most expensive bike they have is a high-end carbon fiber road
    bike, which costs around $10,000. It''s a beauty!


    User: Wow, that''s quite a price tag! Speaking of prices, how much do the seats
    usually cost? I''m thinking of upgrading mine.


    Forum Member 3: The price of bike seats can vary a lot depending on the brand
    and type. Basic seats can start around $20, while more advanced, ergonomic ones
    can go up to $200 or more. What kind of seat are you looking for?'
- Assistant: Welcome to my bike shop. I'm the owner and I'm happy to help you. What
    can I do for you?
- User: 'User: Hi there! Thanks for joining the conversation. I''m looking for a comfortable
    seat for long rides. Do you have any recommendations, and what are the prices
    like?'
- Assistant: Between 50$ and 100$
- User: 'User: Thanks for the price range! Do you have any specific brands or models
    that you recommend for long-distance comfort?'
- Assistant: For long-distance comfort, I would recommend looking into brands like
    Brooks, Selle Anatomica, and Terry. These brands are known for their comfortable
    and durable seats. Some popular models include the Brooks B17, Selle Anatomica
    X Series, and Terry Fly. Prices for these seats can range from $100 to $200. It's
    always a good idea to try out different seats and see which one feels the most
    comfortable for you.
- User: 'User: Thanks for the recommendations! I''ll definitely check those out. Do
    you have any of these models in stock right now, or would I need to place an order?'
- Assistant: We currently have the Brooks B17 and Terry Fly models in stock. However,
    availability may vary, so it's best to give us a call or visit the shop to check
    if we have the specific model and color you're interested in.
- User: 'User: Great, I''ll make sure to call ahead. One last questionâ€”do you offer
    any fitting services to help ensure the seat is properly adjusted for maximum
    comfort?'
- Assistant: Yes, we offer fitting services to help ensure that the seat is properly
    adjusted for maximum comfort. Our experienced staff can assist you in finding
    the right seat position and make any necessary adjustments. Just let us know when
