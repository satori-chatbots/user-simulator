- User: 'Hi there! I hope you''re doing well. I wanted to place an order for a pizza
    today. Could you please help me with that?


    Firstly, I''d like to order a large pizza, because I have a pretty big appetite
    today and I think a large size would be just perfect for me. Can you please confirm
    if you have large-sized pizzas available?


    Also, I would love to have some tomato toppings on my pizza. There''s something
    about tomatoes that just adds such a fresh and tangy flavor that I really enjoy.
    Can you make sure to add a generous amount of tomatoes?


    Oh, and while we''re at it, could you tell me if you have any special deals or
    offers on large pizzas today? I always appreciate a good deal!'
- Assistant: I'm sorry for the confusion, but we offer pizzas in small, medium, and
    big sizes. Could you please specify your preference from these options?
- User: 'Oh, I see, thank you for clarifying that. In that case, I''d like to go for
    a big pizza, since it would be closest to the large size I initially had in mind.
    I hope that works out well because I really do have a big appetite today, and
    I am very much looking forward to enjoying every bite of it.


    And as for the toppings, I would still love to have those delightful, fresh, and
    tangy tomato slices on my pizza. Please make sure they are generously added because
    they make such a significant difference in the overall taste and experience of
    the pizza.


    By the way, I am still curious to know if there are any special deals or offers
    currently available for big pizzas. I always enjoy finding a good deal, and if
    you have something special today, I wouldn''t want to miss out on it. Could you
    please let me know?'
- Assistant: 'Thank you for placing an order for a large pizza!

    I''m glad to hear that you''re interested in our big pizza! However, I noticed
    that you mentioned tomato as a topping. Unfortunately, we don''t offer tomato
    as a topping. Our available toppings are cheese, mushrooms, pepper, ham, bacon,
    pepperoni, olives, corn, and chicken. Could you please choose from these options?'
