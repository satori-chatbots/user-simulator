- User: Hi there, I would like to order a medium pizza with extra cheese on it, and
    I was wondering if you could let me know what other topping options you have available,
    also, could you please tell me what sides and beverages you offer, and if there
    are any ongoing deals or discounts that I could take advantage of today, and finally,
    could you let me know how long the delivery will take to arrive at my location?
- Assistant: Hi there! I see that you've already chosen a medium pizza. Is there anything
    else you need help with?
- User: Yes, I would like to know all the available topping options you offer for
    the pizza besides extra cheese, and could you please also share details about
    the sides and beverages that are available, any special deals or discounts you
    have today, and the estimated delivery time to my location?
- Assistant: 'We appreciate your order for a medium pizza!

    Of course, I can help with that. For toppings, we offer mushrooms, pepper, ham,
    bacon, pepperoni, olives, corn, and chicken. Could you please specify which of
    these toppings you would like on your pizza?'
