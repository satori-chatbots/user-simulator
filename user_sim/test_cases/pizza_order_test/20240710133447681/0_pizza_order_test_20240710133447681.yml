- User: Hi, I'd like to order a small pizza with onion, please.
- Assistant: Hi there! I see you've mentioned that you'd like a small pizza. That's
    great, we have your pizza size noted down. Is there anything else you would like
    to add to your order?
- User: No, just the small pizza with onion is fine. How much will that be?
- Assistant: 'We appreciate your order for a small pizza!

    I''m sorry for the confusion, but we don''t have onions as a topping option. We
    do offer cheese, mushrooms, pepper, ham, bacon, pepperoni, olives, corn, and chicken.
    Could you please choose from these options?'
