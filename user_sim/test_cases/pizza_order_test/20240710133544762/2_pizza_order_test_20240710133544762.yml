- Assistant: Of course, you can add extra cheese on your pizza. However, I noticed
    that you mentioned you want a 'smal' pizza. I believe you meant 'small'. Can you
    please confirm the size of the pizza you want? It can be small, medium, or big.
- User: Yes, I wnt a smal one. Can yu tel me hw much it wil cost wit the xtra cheese?
    alsso, do you hav any speshal deals goinng on rite now?
- Assistant: 'We appreciate your order for a small pizza!

    I''m glad to hear you want a small pizza with extra cheese. However, I need to
    know if you would like any other toppings on your pizza. We offer mushrooms, pepper,
    ham, bacon, pepperoni, olives, corn, and chicken. Please let me know your preference.
    As for the cost and special deals, I recommend contacting the shop directly as
    I am currently unable to provide that information.'
